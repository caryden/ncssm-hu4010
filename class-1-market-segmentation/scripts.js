  1: `Welcome to Class 1: Finding Your First Customers. <break time="0.3s"/> Tonight we're covering Market Segmentation and Beachhead Selection, which are Disciplined Entrepreneurship Steps 1 and 2. <break time="0.3s"/> This is where entrepreneurship really begins, with the fundamental question: who exactly are you building for?`,

  2: `Here's a sobering fact that every entrepreneur needs to understand. <break time="0.5s"/> Most startups fail because they build something nobody wants. <break time="0.3s"/> Not because the technology doesn't work. Not because they ran out of money. But because they built something that didn't solve a real problem for real people.`,

  3: `The root cause of that failure? <break time="0.4s"/> They didn't know who they were building for. <break time="0.3s"/> Or even worse, they tried to build for everyone. When you try to serve everyone, you end up serving no one well.`,

  4: `Here's the counterintuitive truth of entrepreneurship: <break time="0.4s"/> The more specific your target, the more successful you'll be. <break time="0.3s"/> This feels wrong to most people. It feels like you're leaving money on the table. But it's actually the path to success.`,

  5: `Let me tell you the story of Instagram. <break time="0.4s"/> In 2010, there was an app called Burbn. It was a check-in app with photos, messaging, gaming, and about 6 other features. <break time="0.3s"/> Nobody cared. It was trying to do too many things for too many people.`,

  6: `Then came the pivot. <break time="0.4s"/> The founders made a radical decision: strip everything away. Focus on ONE thing for ONE audience. <break time="0.3s"/> That decision changed everything.`,

  7: `Here's what Instagram's beachhead looked like: <break time="0.4s"/> iPhone users, not Android, not all phones. <break time="0.3s"/> Who want to share photos, not text, not video. <break time="0.3s"/> With beautiful filters, not raw images. <break time="0.3s"/> With friends, not the public. <break time="0.5s"/> The result? One million users in just two months. That's the power of focus.`,

  8: `Now let's talk about Step 1: Market Segmentation. <break time="0.3s"/> This is the foundation of everything that follows.`,

  9: `What exactly is a market segment? <break time="0.4s"/> It's a group of customers who share similar characteristics, similar problems, and similar buying behavior. <break time="0.3s"/> They look alike, they act alike, and they can be reached through similar channels.`,

  10: `Why do we segment? <break time="0.4s"/> Because different customers need different everything. <break time="0.3s"/> One product idea branches into many different approaches depending on who you're serving. The features, the pricing, the marketing, the sales process, all of it changes based on the segment.`,

  11: `Let me give you a concrete example. <break time="0.4s"/> Think about an energy drink. It's one product, but it serves completely different segments. <break time="0.3s"/> College students cramming for exams. Truck drivers on long hauls. Esports gamers in competitions. New parents who are sleep-deprived. Gym-goers wanting a pre-workout boost. Office workers fighting the afternoon slump. <break time="0.4s"/> Same energy drink. Completely different customers, different messaging, different channels.`,

  12: `How do you slice the market? <break time="0.4s"/> There are four main ways. <break time="0.3s"/> Demographics: age, location, income, education. <break time="0.3s"/> Psychographics: values, attitudes, lifestyle. <break time="0.3s"/> Behavioral: usage patterns, benefits sought. <break time="0.3s"/> And Situational: context and trigger events. <break time="0.3s"/> The best segments often combine multiple variables.`,

  13: `Your tool for this analysis is the Segmentation Matrix. <break time="0.4s"/> You'll list your potential segments and rate each one on key criteria. This helps you objectively compare opportunities and find your best fit.`,

  14: `Let's talk about the selection criteria. <break time="0.4s"/> Criterion 1 is Problem Intensity. How much does it hurt? <break time="0.3s"/> "Hair on fire" beats "mild inconvenience" every time. You want customers who are desperately seeking a solution, not people who might eventually get around to it.`,

  15: `Look at this problem intensity scale. <break time="0.4s"/> At level one, customers have a latent problem. They don't even know they have it. <break time="0.3s"/> Level two: passive. They're aware but not looking for solutions. <break time="0.3s"/> Level three: active. They're searching but not urgently. <break time="0.3s"/> Level four: urgent. They need it solved now. <break time="0.3s"/> And level five: hair on fire. They'll pay almost anything. <break time="0.5s"/> As an early-stage startup, you want to target levels four and five. That's where the urgency does your selling for you.`,

  16: `Here's why problem intensity matters so much. <break time="0.4s"/> Educating customers about latent problems is expensive. Very expensive. <break time="0.3s"/> You have to convince them they have a problem before you can sell them a solution. <break time="0.4s"/> Instead, find people who are already feeling the pain. <break time="0.3s"/> Let urgency do your selling for you.`,

  17: `Criterion 2: Accessibility. <break time="0.4s"/> Can you actually reach these customers? <break time="0.3s"/> The best customers in the world don't matter if you can't talk to them, sell to them, and deliver to them. Accessibility is often underestimated.`,

  18: `Criterion 3: Market Size. <break time="0.4s"/> You need a market that's big enough to matter, but small enough to win. <break time="0.3s"/> Next week we'll calculate TAM precisely, but for now, use your judgment. Can this segment support a real business?`,

  19: `Two more criteria to consider. <break time="0.4s"/> Competition: How well served is this segment already? Is there an opening for you? <break time="0.3s"/> And Personal Fit: Do you understand these customers? Are you credible to them? <break time="0.3s"/> Your unique background and expertise matter here.`,

  20: `Now let's move to Step 2: Select Your Beachhead. <break time="0.3s"/> This is where you make the critical decision about where to focus.`,

  21: `Think of your beachhead as your first landing zone. <break time="0.4s"/> Like D-Day: the Allies didn't try to invade Europe everywhere at once. They picked one beach, won it decisively, and then expanded from there. <break time="0.3s"/> Your beachhead is your Normandy.`,

  22: `Why focus on just one segment? <break time="0.4s"/> Because limited resources demand focus. <break time="0.3s"/> Different segments need different everything. <break time="0.3s"/> Word-of-mouth spreads within segments, not across them. <break time="0.3s"/> Domination creates momentum. <break time="0.3s"/> And you can always expand later, but not if you die first trying to do too much.`,

  23: `Here's the paradox you need to accept: <break time="0.4s"/> Going narrow feels risky. <break time="0.3s"/> Going broad is actually risky. <break time="0.4s"/> Your instinct will be to keep your options open. Resist that instinct.`,

  24: `Your beachhead must pass four tests. <break time="0.4s"/> Winnable: Can you become number one in this segment? <break time="0.3s"/> Valuable: Is it worth winning? <break time="0.3s"/> Strategic: Does winning here unlock more opportunities? <break time="0.3s"/> Achievable: Can you actually reach these customers? <break time="0.4s"/> All four must be yes.`,

  25: `Remember, your beachhead is not your final destination. <break time="0.4s"/> It's your starting point. <break time="0.3s"/> Amazon started with books, then expanded to all media, then to everything. <break time="0.3s"/> But they dominated books first before expanding.`,

  26: `Let me give you some red flags to watch for in beachhead selection. <break time="0.4s"/> "Everyone could use this!" Red flag. <break time="0.3s"/> "It's a trillion-dollar market!" Red flag. <break time="0.3s"/> "We can sell to anyone who..." Red flag. <break time="0.3s"/> "We'll start with friends and family." Red flag. <break time="0.3s"/> "We'll figure out the customer later." Biggest red flag of all.`,

  27: `Specificity is power. <break time="0.4s"/> Compare these two descriptions. <break time="0.3s"/> "Small business owners" is too vague. You can't do anything useful with that. <break time="0.3s"/> "Restaurant owners in Durham with 10 to 50 employees who don't have a reservation system" is specific enough to act on. You know exactly who to talk to and what to say.`,

  28: `Look at how Facebook expanded from their beachhead. <break time="0.4s"/> February 2004: Harvard only. <break time="0.3s"/> March 2004: Ivy League. <break time="0.3s"/> September 2004: All US colleges. <break time="0.3s"/> September 2005: High schools. <break time="0.3s"/> September 2006: Everyone. <break time="0.4s"/> That's more than two years of narrow focus before opening up. And that discipline made them unstoppable.`,

  29: `Here are more famous beachheads. <break time="0.4s"/> Uber started with San Francisco tech workers using black car service. <break time="0.3s"/> Airbnb started with conference attendees who needed rooms. <break time="0.3s"/> Slack started as an internal tool at the founder's own gaming company. <break time="0.3s"/> Tesla started with wealthy early adopters who wanted a sports car. <break time="0.4s"/> Notice how specific each of these is.`,

  30: `Now it's time for you to work. <break time="0.4s"/> You have 30 minutes. <break time="0.3s"/> First, brainstorm 6 to 12 potential segments, that's 10 minutes. <break time="0.3s"/> Then score each on the 5 criteria, another 10 minutes. <break time="0.3s"/> Select your top 3 candidates, 5 minutes. <break time="0.3s"/> And prepare to share, 5 minutes. <break time="0.3s"/> Let's get to work.`,

  31: `Let's wrap up with the key takeaways. <break time="0.4s"/> Start with customers, not products. <break time="0.3s"/> Segment to find your best opportunity. <break time="0.3s"/> Pick ONE beachhead to dominate. <break time="0.3s"/> And remember: specific beats broad. Always.`,

  32: `Before next week, here's what you need to do. <break time="0.4s"/> Finalize your segmentation matrix. <break time="0.3s"/> Write your beachhead selection rationale. <break time="0.3s"/> Identify 5 potential customers in that segment. <break time="0.3s"/> Have at least 2 conversations with people in that segment. <break time="0.3s"/> And read Disciplined Entrepreneurship Chapters 3 and 5.`,

  33: `Next week we go deeper into knowing your customer. <break time="0.4s"/> We'll cover End User Profile, Persona, and Total Addressable Market. <break time="0.3s"/> The question we'll answer: Who exactly are you building for? <break time="0.3s"/> See you then.`
