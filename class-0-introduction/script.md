# Class 0: Course Introduction — Narration Script

## Slide 1: Title
> Applications in Entrepreneurship. Based on Bill Aulet's Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework. NCSSM Spring 2026.

*[Brief pause - let title land]*

---

## Slide 2: Can It Be Taught?
> What if entrepreneurship could be taught? It's a question that's been debated for decades. Some say entrepreneurs are born with a special gift. Others say it's pure luck. But what if they're wrong?

---

## Slide 3: Yes, It Can
> It can. And that's exactly what we're going to do this semester. Entrepreneurship isn't magic. It's a set of skills, frameworks, and practices that anyone can learn.

---

## Slide 4: Tonight's Agenda
> Here's what we'll cover tonight. First, we'll bust some common myths about entrepreneurship. Then we'll introduce the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework that will guide our work. We'll preview the semester and what you'll build. And finally, we'll talk about forming teams and getting started.

---

## Slide 5: Myth Busting
> Let's start by clearing up some misconceptions about entrepreneurship. Because what most people believe about it? Turns out to be wrong.

---

## Slide 6: Four Myths
> Here are four myths you've probably heard. Myth one: Entrepreneurs are born, not made. Reality: It's a skill you can learn and practice. Myth two: You need a brilliant idea. Reality: Execution matters far more than ideas. Myth three: It's all about the solo genius. Reality: Teams consistently outperform individuals. And myth four: Entrepreneurs are risk-takers. Reality: Great entrepreneurs actually reduce risk systematically.

---

## Slide 7: The Evidence
> The more times you do it, the better you get. Just like any other craft. This is backed by research. Serial entrepreneurs are significantly more successful than first-timers. Why? Because they've practiced the skills.

---

## Slide 8: Disciplined Entrepreneurship
> Now let me introduce you to our framework for the semester. Disciplined Entrepreneurship. Twenty-four steps to a successful startup. Developed at MIT by Bill Aulet.

---

## Slide 9: Bill Aulet Quote
> Here's what Bill Aulet says. Quote: "We must avoid filling this gap with less than rigorous storytelling, which at times assumes that assembling successful entrepreneurs in front of students so that they can spout platitudes about working hard is sufficient." End quote. In other words, we need a real framework, not just inspiration.

---

## Slide 10: The 24 Steps
> This is the framework. Twenty-four steps organized into six themes. Customer, Value, Acquire, Money, Build, and Scale. Each theme answers a fundamental question about your business. This semester, we'll work through these steps together.

---

## Slide 11: Six Questions
> These are the six questions every startup must answer. One: Who is your customer? Two: What can you do for them? Three: How do they acquire your product? Four: How do you make money? Five: How do you design and build it? And six: How do you scale?

---

## Slide 12: Customer First
> Everything starts with the customer. Not your idea. Not your technology. The customer. This is the most common mistake entrepreneurs make. They fall in love with their solution before understanding the problem.

---

## Slide 13: Spirit and Skills
> Successful entrepreneurs combine two things. The spirit of a pirate. Challenge the status quo. Question assumptions. Be bold. And the skills of a Navy SEAL. Disciplined execution. Systematic approach. Data-driven decisions. You need both.

---

## Slide 14: What We'll Build
> Let me tell you about what you'll build this semester. You won't just learn concepts. You'll apply them to a real venture.

---

## Slide 15: 10-Week Journey
> Here's your ten-week journey. Weeks one and two: Find your customer. Weeks three and four: Define your value proposition. Weeks five and six: Build your business model. Weeks seven and eight: Test and validate. Weeks nine and ten: Pitch and present.

---

## Slide 16: Weekly Rhythm
> Each week has the same rhythm. Monday evenings with me: Learn the framework. Apply it to your venture. Get feedback. Wednesday mornings with Chad: Work sessions to build your deliverables.

---

## Slide 17: Team Formation
> Let's talk about teams. We'll have five teams of approximately six students each. Teams will form over the first two weeks as ideas emerge. Starting week three, every team will give a weekly elevator pitch. And for the final pitch, every team member speaks.

---

## Slide 18: Final Pitches
> May fourth and May eleventh. You'll pitch to real judges. Eight minutes to convince them your venture is viable. This is real. This is what entrepreneurs do.

---

## Slide 19: What We're Looking For
> Here's what we're looking for this semester. Evidence over opinion. Show your work with data. Iteration. Pivot when the evidence says so. Specificity. Concrete details, not vague ideas. And collaboration. Help each other succeed.

---

## Slide 20: What We're NOT Looking For
> And here's what we're NOT looking for. We don't need a successful business idea. Most ventures won't be viable, and that's completely normal. We don't need perfect execution. This is about learning. And we don't need brilliant solo performances. Entrepreneurship is a team sport.

---

## Slide 21: Key Takeaway
> Entrepreneurship is a craft. You learn it by doing it. That's the key takeaway. Let's get started.

---

## Slide 22: Homework
> Before next week, three things. One: Read chapters one and two of Disciplined Entrepreneurship on Market Segmentation and Beachhead Market. Two: Think about problems you've noticed that need solving. Three: Start talking to potential teammates.

---

## Slide 23: Next Week Preview
> Next week we dive into Market Segmentation. How do you find customers worth serving? And which one do you start with? This is Theme One: Who is your customer?

---

## Slide 24: Let's Go!
> Let's build something. Welcome to Applications in Entrepreneurship.
