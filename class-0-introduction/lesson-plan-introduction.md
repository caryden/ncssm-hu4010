# Class 0: Course Introduction & Team Formation Kickoff

**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Duration:** 100 minutes (6:15 - 7:55 PM)
**DE Steps:** N/A (Course foundation)

---

## Session Overview

This foundational session sets the stage for the entire course. Students will understand what entrepreneurship really is (and isn't), why a disciplined approach matters, and how the course will unfold. This year's class is the largest ever—30 students across both campuses—who will form into 5 teams of approximately 6 students each over the first two weeks. This session kicks off team formation and problem identification.

**Note:** Students also have Wednesday morning work sessions with Chad Keister (NCSSM instructor) for additional team time and support.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. **Define entrepreneurship** as a learnable craft, not an innate trait
2. **Distinguish** between SME and IDE entrepreneurship models
3. **Explain** the basic structure of the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework
4. **Understand** course expectations, structure, and deliverables
5. **Begin team formation** process (finalized by Week 2) with ~6 students per team
6. **Begin brainstorming** problems and domains of interest

---

## Key Concepts

### Entrepreneurship Defined
- **Entrepreneurship**: The creation of significant value while capturing a fraction of that value for the creators
- It is a **craft**—teachable and learnable—not a gift or personality type
- Evidence: The more times someone engages in entrepreneurship, the more likely they are to succeed

### SME vs. IDE
| | SME (Small & Medium Enterprise) | IDE (Innovation-Driven Enterprise) |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Profitable lifestyle business | Explosive growth potential |
| **Market** | Local or regional | Global or national |
| **Innovation** | Incremental | Disruptive |
| **Examples** | Restaurant, law firm, dry cleaner | Tech startup, biotech company |
| **Our focus** | — | This is what we study |

### The Disciplined Entrepreneurship Framework
- 24 discrete steps organized into 6 themes
- Sequential but iterative—learning in later steps informs revision of earlier ones
- **Starts with the customer**, not the product
- "Understand first, build second, scale third"

### Spirit of a Pirate, Skills of a Navy SEAL
- **Pirate spirit**: Willing to challenge the status quo, take risks, act without permission
- **SEAL skills**: Rigorous execution, disciplined process, team coordination
- Both are required for entrepreneurial success

## Session Outline

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Welcome & Introductions (3 min)
- Instructor introduction and background
- Brief course overview
- Setting expectations for the session

#### Ice Breaker: "What's Broken?" (7 min)
Each student shares one thing that frustrates them—something they wish worked better in their daily life. This plants the seed for problem identification.

*Capture responses on a shared board—these become initial problem hypotheses.*

---

### Part 1: Why This Matters (15 minutes)

#### Myths About Entrepreneurship (8 min)
**Discuss and debunk common myths:**

1. **"Entrepreneurs are born, not made"**
   - Reality: Data shows practice improves success rates
   - Entrepreneurship can be taught, learned, and practiced

2. **"You need a brilliant idea"**
   - Reality: Ideas are cheap; execution is everything
   - The same idea with different teams produces vastly different outcomes

3. **"It's all about the founder's vision"**
   - Reality: Entrepreneurship is a team sport
   - 2-person teams outperform solo founders; 3-person even better

4. **"Risk-taking is the key"**
   - Reality: Smart entrepreneurs minimize risk through validation
   - The goal is not to take risks but to reduce uncertainty

#### The Bill Aulet Approach (7 min)
- MIT's answer to teaching entrepreneurship rigorously
- Brief biography of Bill Aulet
- Why 24 steps? Decomposing the entrepreneurial challenge
- The 6 fundamental questions every venture must answer

---

### Part 2: Course Overview (15 minutes)

#### Walk Through the Syllabus (8 min)
- Course structure and schedule
- Weekly rhythm: Concept → Application
- Deliverables and expectations
- Final pitch format and evaluation

#### The DE Canvas Preview (7 min)
- Show the DE Canvas as the "map" we'll fill in
- Explain how weekly work builds toward a complete picture
- Emphasize iteration—it's meant to be revised
- **Preview:** Starting Week 3, each class opens with team elevator pitches

---

### Break (5 minutes)

---

### Part 3: Team Formation Kickoff (25 minutes)

#### Why Teams? (5 min)
- Evidence for team superiority over solo founders
- Complementary skills > similar skills
- The importance of trust and communication
- **This year:** 5 teams of ~6 students each (our largest class ever!)

#### Team Formation Timeline (5 min)
Explain the two-week formation process:
- **Week 1 (tonight):** Self-assessment, initial conversations, identify interests
- **Week 2:** Finalize teams based on shared interests and complementary skills
- **Week 3 onward:** Teams locked; weekly elevator pitches begin
- **Wednesday sessions:** Use time with Chad to discuss potential teammates

#### Self-Assessment Exercise (10 min)
Have students rate themselves on:

| Skill | 1 (Low) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 (High) |
|-------|---------|---|---|---|----------|
| Technical/Building | | | | | |
| Design/Creativity | | | | | |
| Business/Strategy | | | | | |
| Communication/Sales | | | | | |
| Research/Analysis | | | | | |
| Leadership/Organizing | | | | | |

*Share these openly—teams need diverse skills across 6 people.*

#### Initial Conversations (5 min)
- Students share their interests and skill profiles
- Encourage talking to people you don't know
- Identify 2-3 people whose interests align with yours
- **No commitments yet**—use this week to explore

---

### Part 4: Problem Brainstorming (15 minutes)

#### Domains of Interest (8 min)
Teams discuss and list:
- **Personal frustrations**: What annoys you daily?
- **Observed problems**: What do you see others struggling with?
- **Domains you know**: What areas do you have unique insight into?
- **Trends you've noticed**: What's changing in the world?

*Emphasize: We're brainstorming PROBLEMS, not solutions.*

#### Initial Problem Statements (7 min)
Working individually or in small groups of interest, draft 2-3 problem statements in this format:

> "[Who] struggles with [what problem] because [why], which results in [consequences]."

Example:
> "High school students struggle with staying focused during homework because their phones constantly notify them, which results in longer study sessions and lower quality work."

### Closing (5 minutes)

#### Wrap-Up
- Recap key themes: craft, team, customer-first
- Preview next week: Market Segmentation + Finalize Teams
- **Reminder:** Teams must be finalized by end of next week
- **Coming soon:** Starting Week 3, each class opens with elevator pitches

#### Homework
1. **Read**: DE Chapter 1 (Introduction) & Chapter 2 (Market Segmentation)
2. **Connect**: Talk to potential teammates; consider who you'd work well with
3. **Wednesday**: Use your session with Chad to discuss team formation
4. **Observe**: Notice problems around you this week; bring observations to class

## Instructor Notes

### Setting the Right Tone
- This is the most important session for establishing culture
- Be authentic about your own entrepreneurial journey
- Emphasize that failure is part of learning
- Make it clear that brilliant ideas are not expected or required

### Common Student Concerns
- "I don't have any good ideas" → Reassure: we'll find problems together
- "I don't know anything about business" → That's what this course teaches
- "What if my team doesn't work out?" → We'll address issues as they arise
- "6 people seems like a lot" → Yes! You'll need diverse skills for everything ahead

### Watch For
- Students isolating themselves during team formation
- Groups forming purely based on existing friendships (some is OK, but encourage mixing)
- Premature attachment to "solutions" rather than problems
- Campus divisions—encourage cross-campus collaboration

---

## Assessment

This session establishes baseline engagement. Note:
- Level of participation in discussions
- Quality of problem observations
- Team dynamics during formation
- Enthusiasm and concerns expressed

---

## Follow-Up

### Before Next Class
- Send welcome email with Syllabus, DE Canvas, and readings
- Share any captured "What's Broken?" responses
