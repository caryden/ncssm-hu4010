# Curriculum Design Research: Applications in Entrepreneurship

**Generated:** 2026-01-24
**Course:** NCSSM Applications in Entrepreneurship (HU4010)
**Target Audience:** High school juniors and seniors at NCSSM (Durham & Morganton)

---

## Executive Summary

This curriculum research document establishes the pedagogical foundations for the NCSSM Applications in Entrepreneurship course. The course is built upon Bill Aulet's **Disciplined Entrepreneurship (DE) framework**, developed at MIT's Martin Trust Center, which provides a structured 24-step methodology for building innovation-driven ventures. This approach was selected over alternative frameworks because it emphasizes entrepreneurship as a **learnable craft** rather than an innate personality trait—a critical mindset shift for academically-oriented high school students.

Research strongly supports **experiential, project-based learning** for entrepreneurship education. Traditional lecture-based approaches are ineffective because entrepreneurship requires dynamic skills developed through practice: customer research, rapid iteration, team collaboration, and comfort with uncertainty. Kolb's experiential learning cycle (concrete experience → reflective observation → abstract conceptualization → active experimentation) provides the theoretical foundation for our weekly structure of concept introduction followed by immediate team application.

The course addresses several documented misconceptions about entrepreneurship that are particularly prevalent among high-achieving students: that entrepreneurs are "born not made," that success requires a brilliant original idea, and that risk-taking is the defining characteristic. By systematically debunking these myths and teaching a repeatable process, the course empowers students who might otherwise self-select out of entrepreneurial pursuits.

## Pedagogical Approaches

### Primary Approach: Experiential Project-Based Learning

The course employs **Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle** as its pedagogical foundation. Research consistently shows that entrepreneurship skills cannot be effectively taught through passive lecture—they require active engagement with real problems.

**Kolb's Four-Stage Cycle as Applied:**

| Stage | In Our Course |
|-------|---------------|
| **Concrete Experience** | Team workshop activities, customer interviews, prototype testing |
| **Reflective Observation** | Weekly elevator pitches with feedback, peer review, debrief discussions |
| **Abstract Conceptualization** | Framework introduction, concept presentation, case study analysis |
| **Active Experimentation** | Apply new concepts to venture, test hypotheses, iterate on deliverables |

**Evidence:**
- [ScienceDirect systematic review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0742051X22002943): Experiential learning in entrepreneurship education shows consistently positive outcomes
- [ResearchGate study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334206723_KOLB'S_EXPERIENTIAL_LEARNING_AS_AN_EFFECTIVE_LEARNING_MODEL_IN_CREATIVE_PRODUCT_AND_ENTREPRENEURSHIP_SUBJECTS): "Kolb's EL model is effective in enhancing students' innovation in creating entrepreneurial opportunities"
- Jones and Iredale (2010): "Entrepreneurship education requires experiential learning styles, creative problem solving and learning by doing"

**Implementation:**
- Each 100-minute class follows: Opening Hook (5 min) → Concept (25 min) → Team Workshop (45 min) → Share/Feedback (15 min) → Wrap-up (10 min)
- Students work in consistent teams of ~6 throughout the semester
- Weekly deliverables require applying concepts to their specific venture
- Wednesday work sessions with Chad Keister provide additional experiential learning time

---

### Secondary Approach: Peer Learning and Feedback

Starting Week 3, each class opens with **2-minute elevator pitches from every team**, followed by feedback. This approach:

1. Builds presentation skills through repetition
2. Creates accountability for weekly progress
3. Develops students' ability to give constructive feedback (critical entrepreneurial skill)
4. Simulates investor/customer interactions

**Evidence:**
- Active learning exercises are shown to be more effective than traditional methods for enhancing concept understanding and critical thinking skills
- Peer feedback develops both evaluative skills and resilience to criticism

---

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Case Method (Harvard-style):** While useful for analysis, pure case study approaches lack the experiential component essential for entrepreneurship. We incorporate brief case discussions (Instagram, Facebook, Amazon examples) but prioritize student venture work.

**Lecture-Based:** Research explicitly warns that "skills and competences necessary for the entrepreneurial world are hardly obtained by traditional teaching with the passive participation of students." Rejected as primary approach.

**Simulation/Games:** While engaging, simulations can feel artificial. We prefer working on real problems with real customer research, though the final pitch competition adds a valuable competitive element.

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: Entrepreneurs Are Born, Not Made

- **What students believe:** Entrepreneurship requires innate traits—charisma, risk tolerance, vision—that you either have or don't. Successful entrepreneurs are fundamentally different from "normal people."
- **Why it's wrong:** Research shows entrepreneurial skills can be acquired and taught. The MIT Leadership Center found charisma is not correlated with entrepreneurial success. Data shows the more times someone engages in entrepreneurship, the more likely they are to succeed—indicating learned skill, not fixed trait.
- **How we address:**
  - Class 0 explicitly debunks this myth with evidence
  - Emphasize "Entrepreneurship is a craft—teachable and learnable"
  - Use DE framework to show systematic, repeatable process
  - Share examples of successful entrepreneurs who learned through iteration, not natural gift

---

### Misconception 2: You Need a Brilliant Original Idea

- **What students believe:** Success requires a groundbreaking, never-before-seen innovation. Without a "Eureka!" moment, there's no point in starting.
- **Why it's wrong:** Ideas are cheap; execution is everything. The same idea with different teams produces vastly different outcomes. Many successful businesses improve existing solutions rather than inventing new categories. Innovation can mean better execution, not just new technology.
- **How we address:**
  - Start with problems, not solutions (Class 0-1)
  - Market segmentation focuses on customer needs, not product ideas
  - Case studies show companies that won through execution (Instagram pivoted from Burbn)
  - Emphasize: "Ideas are cheap. Execution is everything."

---

### Misconception 3: Entrepreneurs Are Risk-Takers/Gamblers

- **What students believe:** Entrepreneurs succeed by taking big risks. Being comfortable with uncertainty and willing to "bet it all" is what separates entrepreneurs from employees.
- **Why it's wrong:** Entrepreneurs are not gamblers. They take *calculated* risks in areas where they have information advantages, then systematically de-risk everything else. The goal is not to take risks but to reduce uncertainty through validation.
- **How we address:**
  - DE framework explicitly about reducing uncertainty through validation
  - Customer research before building
  - MVBP testing before scaling (Class 8)
  - Beachhead strategy minimizes market risk (Class 1)
  - Each step in the 24-step process is designed to validate assumptions before moving forward

### Misconception 4: Entrepreneurs Work Alone (The Solo Genius)

- **What students believe:** Media portrays entrepreneurs as lone visionaries—Zuckerberg, Musk, Bezos. Success comes from individual brilliance.
- **Why it's wrong:** Entrepreneurship is a team sport. Research shows 2-person teams outperform solo founders; 3-person teams even better. Even "solo" founders need mentors, advisors, early employees. The spotlight rarely shines on the teams behind successful founders.
- **How we address:**
  - Mandatory team formation (5 teams of ~6 students)
  - "Entrepreneurship is a team sport" stated as core principle in Class 0
  - Self-assessment exercise identifies complementary skills
  - All team members must present in final pitch
  - Peer feedback develops collaborative skills

### Misconception 5: You Must Start Big

- **What students believe:** To be a "real" entrepreneur, you need to build the next Uber or Facebook. Small ideas aren't worth pursuing.
- **Why it's wrong:** The best entrepreneurs start small and specific, then expand. Facebook started with Harvard students only. Amazon started with books only. Uber started as a black car service in San Francisco. Trying to serve everyone means serving no one well.
- **How we address:**
  - Market segmentation emphasizes specificity (Class 1)
  - Beachhead market concept: win a small segment first
  - "The more specific your target, the more successful you'll be"
  - Progressive expansion to adjacent markets (covered in scale, Class 9)

## Visualization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Market Sizing Funnel (TAM → SAM → SOM)

- **Concept:** Visualizing the progression from Total Addressable Market to Serviceable Available Market to Serviceable Obtainable Market
- **Approach:** Animated funnel that shows the narrowing focus from total market to realistic capture. Can be interactive—click to drill into each level with calculations.
- **Example:** [Antler TAM SAM SOM Guide](https://www.antler.co/blog/tam-sam-som) provides clear visual explanations
- **Adaptation:** D3 visualization with animated transitions showing:
  - TAM: All potential customers (top level)
  - SAM: Customers you can realistically serve (middle level)
  - SOM: Customers you can realistically capture in year 1 (bottom level)
  - Include calculation methodology at each level

---

### Pattern 2: Customer Persona Card

- **Concept:** Visual representation of the ideal customer with demographics, psychographics, goals, and pain points
- **Approach:** Card-based design with photo placeholder, key attributes, and quotes. Makes abstract "customer" concrete and memorable.
- **Example:** [Tufts Derby Center Module 2](https://derbyecenter.tufts.edu/learningcenter/module2/) provides persona templates
- **Adaptation:** Interactive persona builder where teams fill in attributes that animate into final card format. Include:
  - Demographics (age, role, context)
  - Psychographics (motivations, fears)
  - Goals (what they want to achieve)
  - Pain points (what frustrates them)
  - Quote (in their own words)

---

### Pattern 3: Decision-Making Unit (DMU) Network Diagram

- **Concept:** Visualizing the relationships between stakeholders in a B2B purchase decision
- **Approach:** Network graph showing nodes (stakeholders) and edges (relationships/influence). Color-coded by role (Champion, Economic Buyer, End User, etc.)
- **Example:** MEDDIC sales methodology diagrams
- **Adaptation:** Interactive D3 network diagram where:
  - Nodes represent stakeholders (sized by influence)
  - Colors represent roles (Champion = green, Veto = red, etc.)
  - Edges show influence relationships
  - Click nodes to see role details and motivations

---

### Pattern 4: Customer Acquisition Funnel

- **Concept:** Visualizing the stages from awareness to purchase with conversion rates
- **Approach:** Animated funnel or horizontal pipeline showing stage progression, with drop-off rates between stages
- **Example:** Standard sales funnel visualizations
- **Adaptation:** Funnel visualization with:
  - Stages: Awareness → Interest → Evaluation → Decision → Purchase → Onboarding
  - Width proportional to conversion rate
  - Time indicators between stages
  - DMU roles mapped to appropriate stages

---

### Pattern 5: Competitive Positioning Matrix (2x2)

- **Concept:** Plotting competitors on two key dimensions to identify positioning opportunities
- **Approach:** Quadrant chart with competitors as points, highlighting white space opportunities
- **Example:** Boston Consulting Group matrix, Perceptual maps
- **Adaptation:** Interactive D3 scatter plot where:
  - X and Y axes are configurable (team selects dimensions)
  - Competitors plotted with logos/names
  - Team's position can be dragged to explore positioning
  - Quadrants labeled with strategic implications

## Recommendations for Course Plan

Based on this research, the course plan should:

1. **Maintain the customer-first sequence:** The DE framework's emphasis on understanding customers before building products is well-supported by research. The progression from Market Segmentation (Class 1) through Customer Persona (Class 2) before Value Proposition (Class 3) ensures students develop customer empathy before product attachment.

2. **Preserve the myth-busting opening:** Class 0's explicit confrontation of entrepreneurship myths is pedagogically sound. Research confirms these misconceptions are prevalent and persistent. Addressing them upfront creates psychological safety for academically-oriented students who might otherwise self-exclude.

3. **Strengthen the experiential ratio:** The current 45-minute team workshop time is appropriate. Consider extending customer research requirements—research suggests "getting out of the building" is where learning happens. The Wednesday work sessions with Chad provide crucial additional experiential time.

4. **Leverage the elevator pitch practice:** Weekly pitches with peer feedback align with research on active learning and develop both presentation and evaluation skills. The progression from instructor feedback (early weeks) to peer feedback (later weeks) mirrors apprenticeship learning models.

5. **Emphasize team dynamics:** The 6-person team structure is larger than startup research suggests as optimal, but provides valuable experience navigating larger group dynamics. Maintain the self-assessment exercise and emphasis on complementary skills.

## Alignment with Existing Course Content

The current course content, as reflected in the lesson plans and presentations, strongly aligns with this research:

| Research Finding | Course Implementation |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Entrepreneurship as learnable craft | Class 0 opening, repeated throughout |
| Customer-first methodology | Classes 1-5 focus exclusively on customer understanding |
| Experiential learning cycle | Concept → Workshop → Feedback structure in every class |
| Myth debunking | Explicit myths section in Class 0 |
| Team-based learning | 5 teams of ~6, maintained throughout |
| Peer feedback development | Weekly elevator pitches starting Class 3 |
| Visualization of complex concepts | D3 visualizations throughout (funnel, persona, DMU, etc.) |

---

## Questions for Instructor Review

1. **Customer Research Depth:** Should we require more customer interviews (currently 2+ per week)? Research suggests this is the highest-value activity but may be challenging for high schoolers accessing business contacts.

2. **Failure Integration:** The course emphasizes "failure is learning" but doesn't explicitly include failure case studies. Should we add examples of ventures that failed productively?

3. **Competition Balance:** The final pitch format creates competitive dynamics. How do we balance healthy competition with collaborative peer learning?

4. **Cross-Campus Collaboration:** With students on Durham and Morganton campuses, are the current Zoom-hybrid arrangements sufficient for team cohesion?

5. **Assessment Calibration:** The pass/fail grading is intentional, but should rubrics be more explicit for elevator pitch feedback to ensure consistency?
