# Class 1: Market Segmentation & Beachhead Selection

**Date:** February 9, 2026
**Duration:** 100 minutes (6:15 - 7:55 PM)
**DE Steps:** 1 (Market Segmentation), 2 (Select a Beachhead Market)

---

## Session Overview

This session introduces the foundational concept that drives all entrepreneurship: understanding who your customer is. Students will learn systematic approaches to identifying potential customer segments and selecting a "beachhead market"—the initial segment they'll focus on conquering before expanding to others.

**Critical for this session:** Teams must be finalized by the end of class. Students have had a week to connect (including Wednesday work session with Chad), and all 5 teams should be locked in tonight.

The key insight: **Resist the temptation to go broad.** A narrow, well-defined market you can dominate is far more valuable than a huge market where you're invisible.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. **Create** a market segmentation matrix with 6-12 potential customer segments
2. **Apply** segmentation criteria to evaluate market opportunities
3. **Select** a beachhead market using structured decision-making
4. **Articulate** why starting narrow leads to winning big
5. **Avoid** the common trap of trying to serve everyone

## Key Concepts

### Market Segmentation
The process of dividing a broad market into distinct subgroups of customers who have different needs, characteristics, or behaviors.

**Why it matters:**
- Different customers have different problems (even if they seem similar)
- Different customers require different solutions, messaging, and channels
- Trying to serve everyone means serving no one well

### The Segmentation Matrix
A tool for organizing and comparing potential market segments:

| Segment | Description | Problem Intensity | Accessibility | Size | Competition |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|------|-------------|
| A | ... | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | Est. | High/Med/Low |
| B | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Beachhead Market
The first market segment you will target—your initial "landing zone."

**D-Day Analogy:** The Allies didn't try to invade all of Europe at once. They picked Normandy as their beachhead—a specific location they could win, then use as a base to expand.

**Characteristics of a good beachhead:**
1. Customers have urgent need (problem intensity)
2. You can reach them (accessibility)
3. Big enough to matter, small enough to win
4. Winning here opens doors to adjacent markets
5. Competition is beatable

### The Paradox of Specificity
The more specific your target, the more successful you'll be.

> "If you try to build a product for everyone, you'll end up building a product for no one."

## Session Outline

### Opening (15 minutes)

#### Team Finalization (5 min)
**Critical:** Confirm all 5 teams are formed.
- Quick check: Each team stands together
- Any students without teams? Facilitate matching now
- Teams must be locked by end of tonight's class
- Introduce team names/numbers for tracking

#### Hook: The Instagram Story (7 min)
Instagram didn't start as a photo-sharing app for everyone. It started as Burbn—a check-in app. When that failed, they pivoted and targeted a very specific beachhead: **iPhone users who wanted to share filtered photos**.

Not Android. Not flip phones. Not professional photographers. Not people who wanted to share text or video.

*One device. One type of content. One core action.*

That specificity let them perfect the experience and dominate, then expand.

**Discussion:** What other companies started super narrow before going broad?
- Facebook (Harvard students only)
- Amazon (books only)
- Uber (San Francisco black car service)

#### Introduce: Weekly Elevator Pitches (3 min)
**Starting next week:** Each class begins with elevator pitches.
- One person from each team presents (~2 min max)
- Share: Problem, solution, progress
- Feedback from class and instructor
- Rotate who presents each week—everyone participates

### Part 1: Market Segmentation (25 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (12 min)

**What is a market segment?**
A group of potential customers who share:
- Similar characteristics (demographics, behaviors)
- Similar problems or needs
- Similar ways of buying

**Segmentation Variables:**
| Variable Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **Demographics** | Age, gender, income, education, location |
| **Psychographics** | Values, attitudes, interests, lifestyle |
| **Behavioral** | Usage patterns, loyalty, benefits sought |
| **Firmographics** (B2B) | Company size, industry, role |

**Exercise: Brainstorm Segments**
For ANY product (let's use "a new energy drink"):
- Who might want this? List 10+ different types of people
- How are they different from each other?

**Key insight:** Even something as generic as an energy drink has radically different customers (college students cramming, truck drivers on long hauls, gamers in tournaments, new parents, gym-goers, office workers).

#### Building the Matrix (13 min)

**Step 1: List your segments**
- Brainstorm broadly (aim for 6-12)
- Be specific (not "students" but "college students preparing for exams")
- Each segment should be distinct

**Step 2: Define evaluation criteria**
Core criteria to evaluate each segment:

1. **Problem Intensity** (1-5)
   - How painful is the problem?
   - Would they pay to solve it?
   - Is it a "hair on fire" problem?

2. **Accessibility** (1-5)
   - Can you reach these customers?
   - Do you have connections?
   - Are they congregated somewhere?

3. **Market Size** (Estimate)
   - How many potential customers?
   - What's the revenue potential?
   - (We'll calculate TAM next week)

4. **Competition** (1-5)
   - Who else serves this segment?
   - How well are they served?
   - Is there an opening?

5. **Personal Fit** (1-5)
   - Do you understand these customers?
   - Are you passionate about serving them?
   - Can you be credible to them?

### Part 2: Beachhead Selection (20 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (8 min)

**Why choose just one?**
- Limited resources (time, money, attention)
- Different segments need different products/messages
- Word-of-mouth works within segments
- Domination creates momentum

**The Beachhead Criteria:**

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Winnable** | Can you become #1 in this segment? |
| **Valuable** | Is this segment worth winning? |
| **Strategic** | Does winning here unlock other segments? |
| **Achievable** | Can you reach these customers? |

**Adjacent Markets:** Your beachhead should connect to larger markets you can expand into. Draw the "stepping stone" path.

#### Selection Process (12 min)

**Method: Structured Scoring**

1. Score each segment on criteria (1-5 each)
2. Weight the criteria based on your situation
3. Calculate weighted scores
4. Discuss top 2-3 candidates
5. Make a decision (with rationale)

**Warning signs of bad beachheads:**
- "Everyone could use this!" (too broad)
- "It's a trillion-dollar market!" (but your slice?)
- "We can sell to anyone who..." (not specific enough)
- "We'll start with friends and family" (not scalable)

### Break (5 minutes)

### Part 3: Team Workshop (30 minutes)

#### Activity: Build Your Segmentation Matrix (22 min)

Teams work on their own venture/problem:

1. **Brainstorm segments** (10 min)
   - List 6-12 different potential customer segments
   - Be specific—use descriptive names
   - Consider demographics, behaviors, contexts

2. **Evaluate segments** (10 min)
   - Score each on the 5 criteria
   - Use evidence from homework conversations
   - Be honest about what you don't know

3. **Preliminary selection** (5 min)
   - Rank top 3 candidates
   - Identify what you'd need to learn to decide

#### Share & Feedback (8 min)
- 2-3 teams share their top segment choice
- Class provides feedback:
  - Is it specific enough?
  - Does the rationale make sense?
  - What questions would you want answered?
- **Practice:** This is like the feedback you'll give during elevator pitches!

## Instructor Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize
- The discomfort of going narrow is normal—push through it
- "I could sell to anyone" is a red flag, not a strength
- Segmentation is a skill that improves with practice

### Common Mistakes to Watch For
- Segments that are too broad ("businesses")
- Segments based only on demographics (missing behavior/need)
- Selecting beachhead based on size alone
- Not being honest about accessibility

### Discussion Facilitation
- Use Socratic questioning: "How do you know that?" "What evidence supports that?"
- Encourage peer feedback that is constructive and specific
- When teams struggle, ask: "Who do you know in that segment?"
