# Class 7: Unit Economics - LTV & COCA

**Date:** March 23, 2026
**Duration:** 100 minutes (6:15 - 7:55 PM)
**DE Steps:** 17 (Calculate LTV), 18 (Map Sales Process), 19 (Calculate COCA)

---

## Session Overview

This session tackles the mathematical foundation of business viability: unit economics. Students will learn to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and Cost of Customer Acquisition (COCA), understand why the LTV/COCA ratio determines success or failure, and map a realistic sales process. The key shift: from "could this work?" to "will this actually make money?"

Key insight: **A business isn't viable if it costs more to get a customer than that customer is worth.**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. **Calculate** Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) with realistic assumptions
2. **Map** their sales process with resource requirements
3. **Estimate** Cost of Customer Acquisition (COCA)
4. **Evaluate** business viability using the LTV/COCA ratio
5. **Identify** levers to improve unit economics

## Key Concepts

### Lifetime Value (LTV) - Step 17
The total profit generated from an average customer over their entire relationship with your business.

**LTV Formula:**
```
LTV = (Average Revenue Per Customer × Gross Margin) × Average Customer Lifespan
```

Or more precisely:
```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin %) × (1 / Churn Rate)
```

**Components:**
- **ARPU**: Average Revenue Per User (per month or year)
- **Gross Margin**: Revenue minus direct costs of serving customer
- **Lifespan**: How long customers stay (inversely related to churn)
- **Churn Rate**: % of customers who leave per period

**Example:**
- ARPU: $50/month
- Gross Margin: 70%
- Average lifespan: 24 months
- LTV = $50 × 0.70 × 24 = **$840**

### Sales Process (Step 18)
The complete path from lead to closed customer, including all activities, resources, and time required.

**Mapping the Sales Process:**
1. Lead generation (how you find prospects)
2. Qualification (how you filter to serious prospects)
3. Demo/Presentation (how you show value)
4. Proposal/Trial (how you get commitment)
5. Negotiation/Close (how you finalize)
6. Onboarding (how you activate)

**At each stage:** Time required, resources needed, conversion rate

### Cost of Customer Acquisition (COCA) - Step 19
The total cost to acquire one new paying customer.

**COCA Formula:**
```
COCA = Total Sales & Marketing Costs / Number of Customers Acquired
```

**Includes:**
- Marketing spend (ads, content, events)
- Sales salaries and commissions
- Tools and software
- Any other costs to acquire customers

**Example:**
- Marketing spend: $10,000/month
- Sales costs: $8,000/month
- Customers acquired: 20/month
- COCA = $18,000 / 20 = **$900**

### The LTV/COCA Ratio
The most important metric for business viability.

**The Rule:**
```
LTV / COCA > 3
```

| Ratio | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| < 1 | Losing money on every customer |
| 1-3 | Struggling, need improvement |
| > 3 | Healthy business |
| > 5 | Strong—consider investing more in growth |

**Why 3x?**
- Covers acquisition cost
- Covers operational overhead
- Leaves profit margin
- Accounts for uncertainty

## Session Outline

### Weekly Elevator Pitches (15 minutes)

#### Format
- **Each team:** 2 min pitch + 1 min feedback
- **This week's focus:** Include business model and pricing
- **Feedback from:** Peer-led (instructor observes)

#### Guiding Questions for Feedback
- Is the business model clear?
- Does the pricing seem reasonable for the value delivered?
- What assumptions would you want tested?

---

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Hook: The $1 Billion Burn (7 min)
**WeWork's Unit Economics Disaster:**

At its peak, WeWork was valued at $47 billion. Then investors looked at the unit economics:
- Cost to build out a new location: $millions
- Time to profitability per location: 5+ years
- Churn: Higher than expected
- LTV/COCA: Deeply negative

Result: Valuation collapsed to $9 billion, CEO fired, IPO cancelled.

**The lesson:** Brilliant growth means nothing if unit economics don't work.

**Contrast: Zoom**
- COCA: Low (viral product, easy to try)
- LTV: High (sticky, expanding usage)
- LTV/COCA: ~8x
- Result: Sustainable, profitable growth

#### Homework Review (5 min)
- How did business model selection go?
- What pricing did you land on?

### Part 1: Customer Lifetime Value (30 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (15 min)

**What is LTV?**

The total profit (not revenue) you'll earn from an average customer over your entire relationship.

**Why LTV Matters:**
- Tells you how much you can afford to spend acquiring customers
- Shows whether customers are valuable enough to sustain a business
- Reveals the importance of retention

**LTV Formula:**
```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) × Customer Lifespan
```

**Breaking it down:**

1. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**
   - What does the average customer pay per month/year?
   - Include upsells, expansions, add-ons
   - Use realistic averages, not best-case

2. **Gross Margin**
   - Revenue minus direct costs to serve
   - Hosting, support, payment processing, COGS
   - Typically 60-80% for SaaS, lower for physical goods

3. **Customer Lifespan**
   - How long does the average customer stay?
   - Related to churn: Lifespan = 1 / Churn Rate
   - 5% monthly churn = 20-month average lifespan
   - 2% monthly churn = 50-month average lifespan

**LTV Sensitivity:**
Small changes in churn dramatically affect LTV:

| Monthly Churn | Avg Lifespan | LTV (at $50 ARPU, 70% margin) |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 10% | 10 months | $350 |
| 5% | 20 months | $700 |
| 2% | 50 months | $1,750 |

**Retention is everything.**

#### LTV Calculation Exercise (15 min)

Teams calculate their LTV:

1. **Determine ARPU** (5 min)
   - What's your price point?
   - What might customers pay over time? (upsells)

2. **Estimate Gross Margin** (3 min)
   - What does it cost to serve each customer?
   - What's your margin percentage?

3. **Estimate Lifespan** (5 min)
   - How long will customers stay?
   - What's a realistic churn rate for your market?

4. **Calculate LTV** (2 min)
   - ARPU × Margin × Lifespan = LTV

### Part 2: Sales Process & COCA (35 minutes)

#### Mapping the Sales Process (15 min)

**Your Sales Funnel:**

Before calculating COCA, you need to understand your sales process.

| Stage | Activities | Conversion Rate | Time |
|-------|------------|-----------------|------|
| Leads | Marketing brings prospects | 100% (starting point) | - |
| Qualified | Filter to real prospects | 30-50% | 1-2 weeks |
| Demo/Trial | Show the product | 40-60% | 1-2 weeks |
| Proposal | Make an offer | 50-70% | 1-2 weeks |
| Close | Get the deal done | 30-50% | 1-2 weeks |
| Customer | Onboarded and paying | - | 1-2 weeks |

**Calculating funnel efficiency:**
If you start with 100 leads:
- 40 qualified (40%)
- 24 demos (60% of qualified)
- 12 proposals (50% of demos)
- 6 closed (50% of proposals)
- **Lead → Customer conversion: 6%**

**To get 20 customers/month, you need ~333 leads/month.**

#### COCA Calculation (10 min)

**COCA Formula:**
```
COCA = (Marketing Costs + Sales Costs) / Customers Acquired
```

**Marketing Costs:**
- Advertising (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Content creation
- Events and sponsorships
- Marketing salaries (or time value)
- Tools and software

**Sales Costs:**
- Sales salaries and commissions
- Travel and meetings
- Sales tools (CRM, etc.)
- Time value of founders selling

**Example Calculation:**

| Cost Category | Monthly |
|---------------|---------|
| Paid ads | $3,000 |
| Content/design | $1,000 |
| Founder time (sales) | $4,000* |
| Sales tools | $500 |
| **Total** | **$8,500** |

*Value founder time at opportunity cost

If acquiring 10 customers/month:
**COCA = $8,500 / 10 = $850**

#### COCA Calculation Exercise (10 min)

Teams estimate their COCA:

1. **List all acquisition costs** (5 min)
   - Marketing channels and costs
   - Sales activities and costs
   - Don't forget founder time!

2. **Estimate customers/month** (3 min)
   - Based on your sales process
   - Be realistic, not optimistic

3. **Calculate COCA** (2 min)
   - Total costs / customers = COCA

---

### Part 3: The LTV/COCA Ratio (15 minutes)

#### The Moment of Truth (10 min)

**The Viability Test:**
```
LTV / COCA > 3
```

**What your ratio tells you:**

| Ratio | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| < 1 | Crisis | Fundamentally broken |
| 1-2 | Danger | Major changes needed |
| 2-3 | Caution | Improve margins or reduce COCA |
| 3-5 | Healthy | Sustainable business |
| > 5 | Strong | Consider investing more in growth |

**If your ratio is bad, you have options:**

1. **Increase LTV:**
   - Raise prices
   - Reduce churn (improve product/service)
   - Increase upsells/expansion
   - Reduce cost to serve

2. **Decrease COCA:**
   - Find cheaper channels
   - Improve conversion rates
   - Leverage referrals/virality
   - Shorten sales cycle

#### Class Discussion: Ratios (5 min)

Teams share their LTV/COCA ratios (even if rough estimates).
- Which are healthy? Which need work?
- What levers could improve problem ratios?
