# Class 3: Value Proposition & Customer Journey

**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Duration:** 100 minutes (6:15 - 7:55 PM)
**DE Steps:** 6 (Full Life Cycle Use Case), 7 (High-Level Product Spec), 8 (Quantify Value Proposition)

---

## Session Overview

Now that students know WHO their customer is, this session focuses on WHAT they can do for that customer. Students will map the complete customer journey, sketch a high-level product concept, and learn to quantify their value proposition in concrete terms. The key shift: from understanding problems to articulating solutions.

Key insight: **Value is not what YOU think you provide—it's what the CUSTOMER perceives they receive.**

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. **Map** a complete Full Life Cycle Use Case for their customer
2. **Identify** key pain points and opportunities in the customer journey
3. **Sketch** a high-level product specification (without deep technical detail)
4. **Quantify** their value proposition with concrete metrics
5. **Articulate** value in customer terms, not product terms

---

## Key Concepts

### Full Life Cycle Use Case (Step 6)
A comprehensive map of how your customer discovers, acquires, uses, and potentially stops using your product. This includes everything from first awareness to ongoing usage.

**Phases of the Life Cycle:**
1. **Awareness:** How do they learn you exist?
2. **Consideration:** How do they evaluate you?
3. **Acquisition:** How do they purchase/sign up?
4. **Onboarding:** How do they start using?
5. **Usage:** What's the core experience?
6. **Support:** How do they get help?
7. **Renewal/Expansion:** How do they continue or grow?
8. **Churn:** Why might they leave?

### High-Level Product Specification (Step 7)
A visual representation of your solution—NOT detailed technical specs, but a clear picture of what the customer will experience.

**Format:**
- Sketch or wireframe (hand-drawn is fine!)
- Focus on the core experience
- Show the "before" and "after"
- Include key features that deliver the value proposition

### Quantifying Value Proposition (Step 8)
Converting your value claim into concrete, measurable terms.

**Formula:**
```
Value = (As-Is State) - (To-Be State)
```

Or more specifically:
```
Value = (Pain × Frequency) - (Solution Cost + Friction)
```

**Types of Value:**
- **Time saved:** Hours/week freed up
- **Money saved:** Dollars/month reduced costs
- **Revenue increased:** Additional income enabled
- **Risk reduced:** Problems prevented
- **Status/emotional:** How they feel

## Session Outline

### Weekly Elevator Pitches (15 minutes)

#### Format
- **Each team:** 2 min pitch + 1 min feedback
- **This week's focus:** Problem + persona (introduce your customer)
- **Feedback from:** Instructor and peers

#### Guiding Questions for Feedback
- Do I understand the problem clearly?
- Does the persona feel like a real person?
- What would make the pitch stronger?

---

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Hook: The Uber Journey (7 min)
Walk through the complete Uber customer experience, pre-Uber vs. with-Uber:

**Before Uber:**
1. Need a ride → Call taxi company, wait on hold
2. Give address → Hope they understand
3. Wait outside → No idea when it's coming
4. Ride → No control over route, hope meter is honest
5. Arrive → Fumble for cash, calculate tip
6. Receipt → Maybe, if you remember to ask

**After Uber:**
1. Open app → See cars nearby
2. Enter destination → Confirm route and price upfront
3. Track car → Watch it arrive in real-time
4. Ride → Follow along on map, know driver's rating
5. Arrive → Auto-payment, no fumbling
6. Receipt → Automatic email, easy to expense

**Discussion:** What specific value does Uber provide? How would you quantify it?
- Time saved (waiting, paying)
- Uncertainty eliminated (where's my ride? what will it cost?)
- Safety increased (know your driver, route tracked)

#### Homework Review (5 min)
- Quick persona check: Does it feel real now?
- TAM confidence: Any surprises in calculations?

### Part 1: Full Life Cycle Use Case (30 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (15 min)

**Why Map the Full Journey?**
- Your product doesn't exist in isolation
- Customers experience you in context of their whole day
- Every touchpoint is an opportunity (or failure point)
- Helps identify where you can truly add value

**The Life Cycle Framework:**

| Phase | Questions to Answer |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Awareness** | How do they discover you? What triggers the search? |
| **Consideration** | What alternatives do they evaluate? What criteria matter? |
| **Acquisition** | How do they buy/sign up? What friction exists? |
| **Onboarding** | What's the first experience? How quickly do they see value? |
| **Usage** | What's the core job? How often? What context? |
| **Support** | When do they need help? How do they get it? |
| **Renewal** | What keeps them coming back? What drives expansion? |
| **Churn** | Why might they leave? What would pull them away? |

**Exercise: Map Your Own Experience**
Think about a product you use daily (Spotify, Instagram, a game). Walk through each phase. Where is it great? Where is it frustrating?

#### Customer Journey Mapping (15 min)

**Workshop Prep:**
Teams will map their customer's current journey (without their product):

1. Draw a horizontal timeline with 6-8 key moments
2. For each moment, note:
   - What happens
   - How they feel (happy, frustrated, anxious)
   - What they're thinking
   - Pain points
3. Identify the biggest opportunities

### Part 2: Product Specification (20 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (10 min)

**What is a High-Level Product Spec?**

NOT:
- Technical architecture
- Database schemas
- Code specifications
- Detailed feature lists

YES:
- Visual representation of the experience
- Core features that deliver value
- Before/After comparison
- Simple enough to explain in 2 minutes

**Format Options:**
- Hand-drawn sketch
- Simple wireframe
- Storyboard (comic-strip style)
- Mock screenshots

**The "Brochure Test":**
Could you show this to a potential customer and they'd understand what you're offering in 30 seconds?

#### Sketching Workshop (10 min)

Quick exercise: Each team member independently sketches their product vision (5 min), then compare and discuss (5 min).

- No art skills required
- Focus on the core experience
- What does the user see/do at the key moment?

### Part 3: Quantifying Value (25 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (15 min)

**Why Quantify?**

> "If you can't put a number on your value, you can't price your product."

Customers need to justify decisions (to themselves, to bosses, to spouses). Give them the numbers.

**The As-Is / To-Be Framework:**

| Dimension | As-Is (Without You) | To-Be (With You) | Value |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|-------|
| Time spent | 5 hours/week | 1 hour/week | 4 hours saved |
| Cost | $500/month | $200/month | $300/month saved |
| Errors | 10% failure rate | 1% failure rate | 90% reduction |

**Quantification Categories:**

1. **Time Value**
   - Hours saved per week/month
   - Convert to dollars: hours × hourly rate
   - Example: 4 hours/week × $50/hr = $200/week = $10,400/year

2. **Money Value**
   - Direct cost reduction
   - Revenue increase
   - Example: 20% more customers retained = $X additional LTV

3. **Risk Value**
   - Problems prevented
   - Downside avoided
   - Harder to quantify but very real

4. **Emotional/Status Value**
   - Peace of mind
   - Confidence
   - Social recognition
   - Harder to quantify but often decisive

**The 10x Rule:**
Your product should deliver at least 10x the value of its price. If you charge $100/month, you should demonstrably save/create $1,000/month of value.

#### Quantification Exercise (10 min)

Teams calculate their value proposition:
1. List 3 dimensions of value you provide
2. Estimate the "as-is" for each
3. Estimate the "to-be" with your product
4. Calculate the delta
5. Total it up

### Part 4: Workshop - Putting It Together (15 minutes)

#### Integration Activity (15 min)

Teams combine their work into a coherent story:

1. **The Journey** (5 min)
   - Our persona, [Name], currently experiences [problem]
   - The key pain points are [X, Y, Z]
   - Here's what their journey looks like today...

2. **The Solution** (5 min)
   - Our product does [core function]
   - Here's a sketch of what they'd experience...
   - The key features are [A, B, C]

3. **The Value** (5 min)
   - We save them [X hours/week] and [$Y/month]
   - That's [total quantified value]
   - Compared to our price of [estimate], that's [X]x return

---

### Part 5: Share & Feedback (10 minutes)

#### Quick Presentations (8 min)
2-3 teams share their:
- Persona reminder (one line)
- Journey pain point (one moment)
- Product sketch (30 seconds)
- Quantified value (one number)

#### Feedback Discussion (2 min)
- Is the value clear and believable?
- Would the persona pay for this?
- What's missing?

## Instructor Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize
- Value is perceived by the customer, not claimed by you
- Quantification forces rigor—"a lot better" isn't good enough
- The product sketch is intentionally rough—details come later

### Common Mistakes to Watch For
- Focusing on features instead of customer experience
- Value that isn't quantified or is wildly optimistic
- Journey maps that skip the boring parts (acquisition, support)
- Confusing what you WANT to provide with what customers NEED

### Facilitation Tips
- Use the Uber example as a touchstone throughout
- Challenge quantification: "How do you know that number?"
- Encourage rough sketches—perfectionism slows progress

---
