## Key Concepts

### Follow-on Markets TAM (Step 14)
Your beachhead is just the beginning. Sustainable businesses expand into adjacent markets.

**Expansion Strategy:**
1. Win the beachhead (establish credibility)
2. Identify adjacent segments with similar needs
3. Leverage beachhead success to enter new markets
4. Calculate TAM for each expansion market

**Why it matters:**
- Investors want to see growth potential
- Validates that beachhead leads somewhere
- Helps prioritize which markets to enter next

### Business Model (Step 15)
Your business model defines HOW you capture value from the value you create.

**Common Business Models:**

| Model | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **One-time sale** | Pay once, own forever | Cars, appliances |
| **Subscription** | Recurring payment for access | Netflix, SaaS |
| **Freemium** | Free basic + paid premium | Spotify, Dropbox |
| **Marketplace** | Take a cut of transactions | Airbnb, Uber |
| **Razor/Blade** | Cheap device + expensive consumables | Printers, Keurig |
| **Advertising** | Free product, sell attention | Google, Facebook |
| **Licensing** | Pay for rights to use IP | Microsoft, Qualcomm |
| **Usage-based** | Pay per use | AWS, Twilio |

**Choosing a Model:**
- What do customers expect in your market?
- How do you want customers to experience payment?
- What aligns with how you deliver value?
- What creates stickiness and recurring revenue?

### Pricing Framework (Step 16)
Pricing is based on VALUE TO CUSTOMER, not your costs.

**The Pricing Principle:**
```
Price = Customer Value × Capture Rate
```
Where capture rate is typically 10-20% of the value you create.

**Pricing Approaches:**
1. **Cost-plus:** Your costs + margin (common but suboptimal)
2. **Competitive:** Match or undercut competitors
3. **Value-based:** Price according to value delivered (ideal)

## Session Outline

### Weekly Elevator Pitches (15 minutes)

#### Format
- **Each team:** 2 min pitch + 1 min feedback
- **This week's focus:** Include acquisition strategy—how will you reach customers?
- **Feedback from:** Mostly peers by now (instructor guides)

---

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Hook: The Pricing Revolution (10 min)
**Adobe's Transformation:**

In 2013, Adobe changed from selling Photoshop for $699 one-time to $9.99/month subscription.

**Wall Street said they were crazy.** Revenue would drop!

**Results:**
- Revenue went from $4B (2013) to $19B (2023)
- Stock price up 10x
- More customers than ever
- Predictable, growing recurring revenue

**The insight:** How you charge is as important as what you charge.

**Discussion:** What other companies changed their pricing model dramatically?
- Microsoft (Office 365)
- Salesforce (pioneered SaaS)
- Dollar Shave Club (subscription razors)

#### Homework Review (5 min)
- How did DMU mapping go?
- Any surprises in the acquisition process?

### Part 1: Follow-on Markets (20 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (10 min)

**Beyond the Beachhead**

Your beachhead is where you START, not where you STAY.

**The Expansion Path:**
```
Beachhead → Adjacent Market 1 → Adjacent Market 2 → Mass Market
```

**What makes markets "adjacent"?**
- Similar customer needs
- Shared technology/product capabilities
- Referenceable success (beachhead win opens doors)
- Logical expansion in customer's mind

**Example: Amazon**
- Beachhead: Books
- Adjacent 1: Music, DVDs, electronics
- Adjacent 2: Everything retail
- Follow-on: Cloud computing (AWS)

**Calculating Follow-on TAM:**
Same bottom-up method as beachhead:
```
TAM = # Customers × Revenue per Customer
```

**Total Addressable Vision:**
Beachhead TAM + Follow-on TAMs = Total Vision

#### Follow-on Identification Exercise (10 min)

Teams identify their expansion path:
1. What's your beachhead TAM? (from earlier)
2. What are 2-3 adjacent markets you could enter?
3. Estimate TAM for each
4. What's the total opportunity?

### Part 2: Business Model Selection (30 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (15 min)

**What is a Business Model?**

Your business model answers: "How do you capture value from the value you create?"

**The Business Model Zoo:**

1. **One-Time Purchase**
   - Customer pays once, owns product
   - Pro: Simple, large upfront revenue
   - Con: Must constantly find new customers
   - Examples: Appliances, cars, books

2. **Subscription**
   - Recurring payment for ongoing access
   - Pro: Predictable revenue, customer relationship
   - Con: Must continuously deliver value
   - Examples: Netflix, SaaS, gym memberships

3. **Freemium**
   - Free basic version, paid premium
   - Pro: Low barrier to adoption
   - Con: Conversion rates typically 2-5%
   - Examples: Spotify, Dropbox, mobile games

4. **Marketplace/Platform**
   - Connect buyers and sellers, take a cut
   - Pro: Network effects, high margins at scale
   - Con: Chicken-and-egg problem starting out
   - Examples: Airbnb, Uber, eBay

5. **Razor and Blade**
   - Cheap/free device, expensive consumables
   - Pro: Lock-in, recurring revenue
   - Con: Requires integrated hardware/software
   - Examples: Printers/ink, Keurig/pods, gaming consoles

6. **Advertising**
   - Product free, sell user attention
   - Pro: Massive user base potential
   - Con: Need huge scale, privacy concerns
   - Examples: Google, Facebook, TikTok

7. **Usage-Based**
   - Pay for what you use
   - Pro: Aligns cost with value, low barrier
   - Con: Revenue unpredictable
   - Examples: AWS, Twilio, electricity

**Choosing Your Model:**

| Question | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| What do customers expect? | Industry norms matter |
| How is value delivered? | Continuous value → subscription |
| What creates stickiness? | Switching costs, habits |
| What's your cash flow need? | Subscription = steady; one-time = lumpy |
| How do competitors charge? | Differentiation opportunity? |

#### Business Model Workshop (15 min)

Teams evaluate business models:
1. List 3 possible models for your product
2. For each, note pros and cons
3. Select your primary model with rationale
4. Consider: Does it match customer expectations?

---

### Part 3: Pricing Framework (30 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (15 min)

**The Big Pricing Mistake**

Most entrepreneurs price based on COSTS:
```
Price = My Costs + Some Margin
```

This leaves money on the table. Customers don't care about your costs.

**The Right Approach: Value-Based Pricing**
```
Price = Customer Value × Capture Rate (10-20%)
```

**Example:**
- Your product saves customers 10 hours/week
- Their time is worth $50/hour
- Value created: 10 × $50 × 52 weeks = $26,000/year
- Price at 10-15%: $2,600 - $3,900/year ($217-$325/month)

**Three Pricing Approaches:**

1. **Cost-Plus**
   - Calculate costs, add margin
   - Simple but doesn't capture full value
   - Risk: Pricing below what customers would pay

2. **Competitive**
   - Match or undercut competitors
   - Safe but commoditizes your offering
   - Risk: Racing to the bottom

3. **Value-Based** (Recommended)
   - Price according to value delivered
   - Captures more value, differentiates on quality
   - Requires understanding customer value (which you've done!)

**Pricing Psychology:**

| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Anchoring | Show higher price first, then your price |
| Tiers | Good/Better/Best options (most buy middle) |
| Decoy | Add option that makes another look better |
| Charm pricing | $9.99 feels less than $10 |
| Round numbers | $100 feels premium, $99 feels budget |

#### Pricing Exercise (15 min)

Teams develop their pricing:

1. **Calculate value-based ceiling** (5 min)
   - What's the quantified value you provide?
   - What's 10-20% of that?
   - This is your pricing upper bound

2. **Consider competitive context** (5 min)
   - What do alternatives cost?
   - Where do you want to position?

3. **Design pricing structure** (5 min)
   - One price or tiers?
   - How presented?
   - Any psychological tactics?
