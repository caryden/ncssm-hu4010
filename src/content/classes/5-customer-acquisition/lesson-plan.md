# Class 5: Customer Acquisition & Decision-Making Unit

**Date:** March 9, 2026
**Duration:** 100 minutes (6:15 - 7:55 PM)
**DE Steps:** 12 (Determine the DMU), 13 (Map Process to Acquire Customer)

---

## Session Overview

Understanding WHO your customer is matters little if you can't reach them and convince them to buy. This session dives into the buying process: who's involved in the decision, what path leads from awareness to purchase, and how to navigate organizational complexity. The key shift: from product thinking to sales thinking.

Key insight: **The person who uses your product is often not the person who decides to buy it.**

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** all members of the Decision-Making Unit for their product
2. **Map** the roles and motivations of each decision influencer
3. **Create** a complete customer acquisition process flowchart
4. **Calculate** realistic timeline and touchpoints for customer acquisition
5. **Recognize** the difference between B2C and B2B selling dynamics

---

## Key Concepts

### Decision-Making Unit (Step 12)
The DMU is the collection of all people who influence whether a purchase happens. Even in "simple" purchases, multiple people are often involved.

**DMU Roles:**

| Role | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Champion** | Advocates for your solution internally | The manager who found you |
| **End User** | Person who actually uses the product | The employee doing the work |
| **Economic Buyer** | Person with budget authority | CFO, department head |
| **Technical Buyer** | Evaluates technical fit/security | IT department |
| **Influencer** | Shapes opinions but doesn't decide | Industry analyst, consultant |
| **Veto Power** | Can kill the deal | Legal, compliance, security |

**Why it matters:**
- Selling to the wrong person wastes time
- Unknown veto players kill deals at the last minute
- Champions need ammunition to advocate for you
- Different stakeholders have different motivations

### Customer Acquisition Process (Step 13)
The complete path from "never heard of you" to "paying customer." This includes every touchpoint and stage.

**Typical B2B Stages:**
1. **Awareness:** They learn you exist
2. **Interest:** They engage with content/materials
3. **Evaluation:** They compare options
4. **Trial/Pilot:** They test your solution
5. **Decision:** They commit (or don't)
6. **Purchase:** Money changes hands
7. **Onboarding:** They start using

**B2C often simpler but still has stages:**
1. Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Purchase → Use

## Session Outline

### Weekly Elevator Pitches (15 minutes)

#### Format
- **Each team:** 2 min pitch + 1 min feedback
- **This week's focus:** Full problem-solution-market story
- **Feedback from:** Instructor and peers—encourage more peer questions!

#### Guiding Questions for Feedback
- Is the competitive positioning clear?
- Do I understand what makes this team uniquely qualified?
- What's the strongest part of the pitch?

---

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Hook: The Deal That Died (7 min)
Tell a story of a startup that had:
- Amazing product
- Enthusiastic user (end user loved it)
- Great demo
- Verbal commitment

...and then the deal died. Why?

**The IT security team said no.** They were never in the conversation, had concerns about data handling, and vetoed the purchase after 3 months of work.

The startup didn't know about this stakeholder. They didn't map the DMU.

**Lesson:** You can't sell to someone if you don't know they exist.

#### Homework Review (5 min)
- Did anyone reach out to their target customers?
- What did you learn?
- Any surprises about competition?

---

### Part 1: The Decision-Making Unit (35 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (15 min)

**Who Decides?**

Even for consumer products, purchase decisions often involve multiple people:
- Teen buying a phone → Parents have veto power
- Employee choosing software → IT and manager involved
- Spouse buying furniture → Partner weighs in

For B2B, it's even more complex:
- End users want ease of use
- IT wants security and integration
- Finance wants cost savings
- Legal wants compliance
- Executives want strategic fit

**The DMU Framework:**

1. **Champion (Advocate)**
   - Your internal salesperson
   - Believes in your solution
   - Needs: tools to sell internally, success metrics to share

2. **End User**
   - Actually uses the product
   - Cares about: ease of use, time savings, quality
   - May not have buying power but can block adoption

3. **Economic Buyer**
   - Controls the budget
   - Cares about: ROI, cost, risk
   - Often not the person you first talk to

4. **Technical Buyer**
   - Evaluates fit with existing systems
   - Cares about: security, integration, maintenance
   - Can veto for technical reasons

5. **Influencers**
   - Don't decide but shape opinions
   - Could be: consultants, analysts, peers at other companies
   - Important for credibility

6. **Veto Power**
   - Can say no but not yes
   - Often: Legal, Compliance, Security
   - Must be addressed or they'll kill the deal

**Exercise: Map a Purchase You Made**
Think about the last significant purchase you made (phone, laptop, big item). Who influenced the decision? Did anyone have veto power?

#### DMU Mapping Workshop (20 min)

Teams map the DMU for their product:

1. **Identify stakeholders** (10 min)
   - Who are all the people involved in the purchase decision?
   - What role does each play?
   - What does each one care about?

2. **Map relationships** (5 min)
   - Who influences whom?
   - Who has veto power?
   - Who is most important to convince first?

3. **Identify gaps** (5 min)
   - Who are you not sure about?
   - What do you need to learn?

### Part 2: Mapping the Acquisition Process (30 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (15 min)

**From Stranger to Customer**

Every customer goes through a journey from "never heard of you" to "loyal customer." Your job is to understand and optimize that journey.

**The Acquisition Funnel:**

```
    Awareness
       ↓
    Interest
       ↓
   Evaluation
       ↓
    Decision
       ↓
    Purchase
       ↓
   Onboarding
```

**At each stage, ask:**
- How do they move to this stage?
- What do they need here?
- What might cause them to drop out?
- How long does this stage take?

**Example: SaaS Product Acquisition**

| Stage | How They Enter | What They Need | Time |
|-------|---------------|----------------|------|
| Awareness | Google search, referral, ad | Landing page that resonates | Instant |
| Interest | Visit website, read content | Clear value proposition | 5 min |
| Evaluation | Sign up for free trial | Easy onboarding, quick wins | 1-7 days |
| Decision | Trial results, sales call | ROI proof, objection handling | 1-4 weeks |
| Purchase | Contract/payment | Simple process, reassurance | 1 day |
| Onboarding | First real use | Training, support, quick wins | 1-4 weeks |

**B2B vs B2C Differences:**

| Aspect | B2C | B2B |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Decision time | Minutes to days | Weeks to months |
| Stakeholders | 1-3 people | 5-15 people |
| Sale type | Self-service | Sales-assisted |
| Contract | Simple | Complex |
| Risk tolerance | Higher | Lower |

#### Process Mapping Workshop (15 min)

Teams map their customer acquisition process:

1. **Identify stages** (5 min)
   - What are the key steps from awareness to purchase?
   - How does your customer typically buy?

2. **Detail each stage** (7 min)
   - How do they enter this stage?
   - What do they need?
   - What could go wrong?
   - How long does it take?

3. **Calculate total cycle** (3 min)
   - End-to-end: How long from first touch to paying customer?
   - Is this realistic?

### Part 3: Integration & Sales Strategy (20 minutes)

#### Connecting DMU to Process (10 min)

**Who is involved at each stage?**

Map DMU roles to acquisition stages:
- Awareness: Who first discovers you?
- Evaluation: Who tests/reviews?
- Decision: Who has final say?
- Purchase: Who signs the check?

**Common patterns:**
- Champion finds you, brings to economic buyer
- End users trial, IT evaluates security
- Economic buyer decides, legal reviews
- Finance processes payment

**Your job:** Know who matters at each stage and what they need.

#### Sales Strategy Discussion (10 min)

**How will you actually sell?**

Options:
1. **Self-service:** Customer buys without talking to anyone
2. **Inside sales:** Phone/video sales process
3. **Field sales:** In-person sales process
4. **Channel sales:** Sell through partners

**Match to your product:**
- Low price + simple → Self-service
- Medium price + some complexity → Inside sales
- High price + complex → Field sales
- Hard to reach customers → Channel sales

---

### Part 4: Share & Feedback (10 minutes)

#### Quick Presentations (8 min)
2-3 teams present:
- Who is your champion? Economic buyer?
- What's your acquisition process (stages)?
- How long is the sales cycle?

#### Feedback Discussion (2 min)
- Is the DMU complete?
- Is the process realistic?
- Are there hidden stakeholders?
