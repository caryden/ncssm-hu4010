# Class 8: Testing Assumptions & MVBP

**Date:** April 13, 2026 (After Spring Break)
**Duration:** 100 minutes (6:15 - 7:55 PM)
**DE Steps:** 20 (Identify Key Assumptions), 21 (Test Key Assumptions), 22 (Define MVBP), 23 (Show Dogs Eat Dog Food)

---

## Session Overview

Welcome back from Spring Break! This session marks the shift from planning to proving. Students will identify the critical assumptions their business depends on, design experiments to test them, and define their Minimum Viable Business Product (MVBP). The key shift: from "this should work" to "let me prove it."

Key insight: **The goal isn't to build a product—it's to test whether customers will pay for it.**

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** key assumptions their business depends on
2. **Prioritize** assumptions by risk and importance
3. **Design** minimal experiments to test assumptions
4. **Define** a Minimum Viable Business Product (not just MVP)
5. **Understand** the difference between validation and building

---

## Key Concepts

### Identifying Key Assumptions (Step 20)
Every business plan is built on assumptions—things you believe but haven't proven. Identifying them is the first step to reducing risk.

**Categories of Assumptions:**

| Category | Example Assumptions |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Customer** | They have this problem; they'll pay to solve it |
| **Value Prop** | Our solution actually solves the problem |
| **Product** | We can build this; it will work as expected |
| **Business Model** | This pricing will work; this channel reaches them |
| **Competition** | We can differentiate; we can win |

**The Assumption Matrix:**
Rate each assumption on:
- **Importance:** How critical is this to success? (1-5)
- **Certainty:** How confident are you it's true? (1-5)

High importance + Low certainty = **Test this first**

### Testing Key Assumptions (Step 21)
Design the smallest possible experiment to validate or invalidate each key assumption.

**Good Tests Are:**
- **Fast:** Days or weeks, not months
- **Cheap:** Minimal resources required
- **Decisive:** Clearly proves or disproves the assumption
- **Measurable:** Has a clear success metric

**Testing Techniques:**

| Technique | What It Tests | Effort |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Landing page | Demand/interest | Low |
| Customer interviews | Problem/need | Low |
| Smoke test (fake door) | Willingness to pay | Low |
| Wizard of Oz | Solution viability | Medium |
| Prototype | Usability | Medium |
| Concierge MVP | Full experience | High |

### Minimum Viable Business Product - MVBP (Step 22)
Not just MVP—MVBP has three criteria:

1. **Customer gets value** - The product actually solves their problem
2. **Customer pays money** - They're willing to exchange money for it
3. **You get feedback** - You learn something actionable

**MVP vs MVBP:**

| MVP | MVBP |
|-----|------|
| Minimum product that works | Minimum product people will PAY for |
| Tests "can we build it?" | Tests "will they buy it?" |
| May be free | Requires transaction |
| Validates technology | Validates business |

### Dogs Eat the Dog Food (Step 23)
Prove that real customers will actually buy and use your product—not friends, not family, not free users, but paying strangers.

**Validation Hierarchy:**

| Level | Strength | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Opinion | Weakest | "I would probably buy this" |
| Intent | Weak | "Sign me up when it's ready" |
| Commitment | Medium | "Here's my email, let me know" |
| Payment | Strong | "Take my money now" |
| Usage | Strongest | "I'm using it and renewing" |

## Session Outline

### Weekly Elevator Pitches (15 minutes)

Welcome back from Spring Break! Let's see how pitches have evolved.

#### Format
- **Each team:** 2 min pitch + 1 min feedback
- **This week's focus:** Unit economics + key assumptions to test
- **Feedback from:** Peer-led—by now, students should be asking tough questions!

#### Guiding Questions for Feedback
- Does the LTV/COCA ratio look viable?
- What are the riskiest assumptions?
- What would you test first?

---

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Welcome Back + Hook (7 min)
**The Dropbox Validation:**

Drew Houston wanted to build a file syncing service. He had an idea but no product. Instead of building first, he:

1. Made a 3-minute video showing what it would do
2. Posted it to Hacker News
3. Signups went from 5,000 to 75,000 overnight

He didn't build anything—he tested whether people wanted it.

**The key question changed from:**
"Can we build this?" → "Will people want this?"

**Discussion:** What assumption did that video test? What didn't it test?

#### Where We Are (5 min)
- Review: We've covered WHO, WHAT, HOW ACQUIRE, HOW MAKE MONEY
- Now: HOW DESIGN & BUILD (but smartly—test before you build)
- DE Canvas check-in: How complete is yours?

### Part 1: Identifying Assumptions (25 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (10 min)

**Everything Is an Assumption**

Your business plan is a collection of beliefs. Until tested, they're just guesses.

**Common Assumptions to Challenge:**

| What You Believe | The Question |
|------------------|--------------|
| "They have this problem" | Have you witnessed it? Heard them complain? |
| "They'll pay $X for a solution" | Have they paid for similar things? |
| "We can build this" | Do you have the skills/resources? |
| "We can reach them through Y" | Have you tried? What's the response? |
| "We're better than competitors" | Have customers confirmed this? |

**The Assumption Matrix:**

Plot each assumption on two axes:
- **Y-axis: Importance** (if wrong, business fails)
- **X-axis: Certainty** (how confident are you?)

| | High Certainty | Low Certainty |
|--|----------------|---------------|
| **High Importance** | Monitor | **TEST NOW** |
| **Low Importance** | Ignore | Test later |

#### Assumption Identification Exercise (15 min)

Teams list their assumptions:

1. **Brainstorm assumptions** (7 min)
   - Customer assumptions
   - Value proposition assumptions
   - Product/technology assumptions
   - Business model assumptions
   - Competitive assumptions

2. **Prioritize** (5 min)
   - Rate each: Importance (1-5), Certainty (1-5)
   - Identify top 3 most risky (high importance, low certainty)

3. **Share** (3 min)
   - What's your #1 riskiest assumption?

---

### Part 2: Testing Assumptions (25 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (10 min)

**The Art of the Experiment**

For each risky assumption, design a test that:
- Is **fast** (days, not months)
- Is **cheap** (minimal resources)
- Is **decisive** (clear pass/fail criteria)
- Generates **learning** (not just a yes/no)

**Testing Techniques:**

1. **Landing Page Test**
   - Build a page describing your product
   - Drive traffic to it
   - Measure: Signups, clicks, engagement
   - Tests: Is there interest? Does the message resonate?

2. **Customer Interviews**
   - Talk to 10-20 potential customers
   - Ask about their problems and current solutions
   - Tests: Is the problem real? How do they solve it today?

3. **Smoke Test / Fake Door**
   - Create a "buy now" button that doesn't work (apologize after)
   - Measure: Click-through rate
   - Tests: Will they actually try to buy?

4. **Wizard of Oz**
   - Customers think it's automated; you do it manually
   - Deliver the service by hand behind the scenes
   - Tests: Does the solution work? What's the experience?

5. **Concierge MVP**
   - Serve customers manually, like a consultant
   - Deeply personalized, doesn't scale
   - Tests: Full value proposition, willingness to pay

**Success Metrics:**
Every test needs a pre-defined success threshold:
- "If 5% of landing page visitors sign up, we proceed"
- "If 3 out of 10 interviewees mention this problem unprompted, it's real"
- "If 2% of visitors click 'Buy Now', there's demand"

#### Test Design Workshop (15 min)

Teams design tests for their top 3 assumptions:

1. **Pick your riskiest assumption** (2 min)
2. **Choose a testing technique** (3 min)
3. **Design the experiment** (5 min)
   - What will you do?
   - Who will you test with?
   - What will you measure?
   - What's your success threshold?
4. **Plan execution** (5 min)
   - When can you run this test?
   - What do you need?

### Part 3: Minimum Viable Business Product (25 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (10 min)

**Beyond MVP**

Eric Ries popularized "Minimum Viable Product"—the smallest thing you can build to learn.

Bill Aulet goes further with **MVBP**—Minimum Viable Business Product:

```
MVBP = MVP + Paying Customers + Feedback Loop
```

**Three MVBP Criteria:**

1. **Customer gets value**
   - The product actually solves their problem
   - Not a demo, not a mockup—real value delivered

2. **Customer pays money**
   - Even if it's $1, they're exchanging value
   - Payment = validation (talk is cheap)

3. **You get feedback**
   - Learn what works and what doesn't
   - Improve based on real usage

**MVBP Examples:**

| Company | MVBP | What It Proved |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Dropbox | Video + waitlist | Demand exists |
| Zappos | Photos + manual fulfillment | People buy shoes online |
| Groupon | WordPress blog + PDF coupons | Local deals work |
| Airbnb | Founders' apartment | Strangers will pay to stay |

#### Dogs Eat the Dog Food (10 min)

**The Ultimate Test**

You haven't validated until strangers (not friends/family) pay you real money for real value.

**Validation Hierarchy:**

| Level | What They Say/Do | Strength |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Opinion | "That's interesting" | 0% |
| Interest | "Tell me more" | 10% |
| Intent | "I would buy that" | 20% |
| Commitment | "Email me when ready" | 40% |
| Pre-order | "Here's $10 deposit" | 70% |
| Purchase | "Shut up and take my money" | 90% |
| Repeat | "I'm renewing" | 100% |

**Your goal:** Get to Payment level with real customers.

#### MVBP Definition Workshop (5 min)

Teams define their MVBP:

1. **What's the minimum you could build/do that...**
   - Delivers real value
   - Someone would pay for
   - Gives you learning?

2. **Write a one-sentence MVBP description:**
   "Our MVBP is [what] that [delivers value] and costs [price]"

## Instructor Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize
- Testing is not failing—it's learning
- Payment is the only true validation
- Founders often test the easy assumptions, not the risky ones

### Common Mistakes to Watch For
- Testing assumptions they're already confident about
- Tests that take too long or cost too much
- MVBP that isn't actually "minimum"
- Counting friend/family interest as validation

### Facilitation Tips
- Push on certainty: "How do you KNOW that?"
- Celebrate falsified assumptions (learning!)
- Help scope down MVBPs (simpler is better)

---

## Assessment

### Formative (During Class)
- Rigor in assumption identification
- Quality of test designs
- Realism of MVBP scope

### Deliverables (Due Next Week)
- Assumption matrix with top 3 identified
- Test plans for each risky assumption
- MVBP definition
- Test results (if executed)
