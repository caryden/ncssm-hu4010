## Course Overview

This course introduces high school students to the disciplined, systematic approach to building innovation-driven ventures. Based on Bill Aulet's *Disciplined Entrepreneurship* framework developed at MIT, students will learn that entrepreneurship is not about luck or innate talent—it's a craft that can be learned and practiced.

Through hands-on exercises, team collaboration, and real-world application, students will work through a structured process of identifying customer needs, validating ideas, and building the foundation for viable businesses. The course culminates in pitch presentations to a panel of judges, simulating the experience of presenting to investors.

### Why This Approach?

Traditional entrepreneurship education often relies on "storytelling"—bringing successful founders in front of students to share their journeys. While inspiring, this approach can be misleading. As Bill Aulet notes: "We must avoid filling this gap with less than rigorous 'storytelling,' which at times assumes that assembling successful entrepreneurs in front of students so that they can spout platitudes about working hard is sufficient."

Instead, this course teaches entrepreneurship as a **systematic, repeatable process**. Data shows that the more times a person engages in entrepreneurship, the more likely they are to succeed—just like any other craft, we get better with practice and proper methodology.

## Learning Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Customer First**
   Every venture starts with understanding a real customer problem. We design from the customer backward, not from the product forward.

2. **Entrepreneurship is a Team Sport**
   Research shows two-person teams have better odds than individuals; three-person teams even better. You will work in teams throughout the course.

3. **Spirit of a Pirate, Skills of a Navy SEAL**
   Entrepreneurs must be willing to challenge the status quo while maintaining rigorous discipline in execution.

4. **Failure is Learning**
   In this course, failure is not just accepted—it's expected and encouraged. The goal is to fail fast, learn quickly, and iterate.

5. **Mens et Manus** (Mind and Hand)
   Borrowing MIT's motto: theory without practice is incomplete. Every concept will be immediately applied to your venture.

## The Disciplined Entrepreneurship Framework

The course follows Bill Aulet's 24-step framework, organized into six fundamental questions:

### Theme 1: Who Is Your Customer? (Steps 1-5)
The search for the "Holy Grail of Specificity"—understanding exactly who you're building for.

### Theme 2: What Can You Do for Your Customer? (Steps 6-11)
Defining your value proposition and what makes you uniquely positioned to solve their problem.

### Theme 3: How Does Your Customer Acquire Your Product? (Steps 12-13)
Understanding the complete buying process, from awareness to purchase.

### Theme 4: How Do You Make Money? (Steps 14-19)
Designing your business model and ensuring the economics work.

### Theme 5: How Do You Design and Build Your Product? (Steps 20-23)
Testing assumptions and building the Minimum Viable Business Product (MVBP).

### Theme 6: How Do You Scale Your Business? (Step 24)
Planning for growth beyond your initial beachhead market.

## Class Structure

Each Monday session runs 6:15 - 7:55 PM (100 minutes) and follows a consistent format:

### Opening: Elevator Pitches (15-20 min)
Starting in Week 3 (after teams are formed), each class opens with **elevator pitches from every team**:
- One representative from each team gives a **<2 minute pitch**
- Immediate feedback follows each pitch
- Early weeks: Feedback primarily from Cary
- Later weeks: **Peer feedback from classmates** (the goal!)

*This weekly practice builds presentation skills and keeps teams accountable for progress.*

### Core Content (35-40 min)
- **Opening Hook** (5 min): Real-world example or provocative question
- **Key Concepts** (20-25 min): Interactive presentation of the evening's framework
- **Case Study/Discussion** (10 min): Application to well-known companies

### Team Application (40-45 min)
- **Team Workshop** (30-35 min): Apply concepts to your venture
- **Brief Share-outs** (5-10 min): Quick progress check from teams
- **Wrap-up & Assignment** (5 min): Next steps and homework preview

### Wednesday Work Sessions
In addition to Monday classes, teams have **Wednesday morning work sessions with Chad Keister**. Use this time to:
- Work on deliverables
- Conduct customer research
- Get additional coaching and feedback
- Collaborate with teammates

---

## Team Formation

### Team Structure
- **Maximum 5 teams** for the entire class (required for final pitch logistics)
- **~6 students per team** (with 30 students across both campuses)
- Teams may include students from both Durham and Morganton campuses

### Formation Timeline
Teams form over the **first two weeks** of class:
- **Week 1 (Feb 2):** Introductions, identify interests, start networking
- **Week 2 (Feb 9):** Teams finalize by end of class
- **Week 3 onward:** Teams begin weekly elevator pitches

### Why Larger Teams?
While research shows 2-3 person teams are ideal for startups, our 5-team limit (necessary for final presentations) means larger teams. This is actually valuable practice:
- Learn to collaborate across a larger group
- Divide work effectively
- Navigate different perspectives and opinions
- Simulate real startup teams that grow over time

### Team Dynamics
- All team members must contribute meaningfully
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities early
- Practice giving and receiving constructive feedback
- Use Wednesday work sessions for team coordination
- **Every team member must speak during the final pitch**

## Assignments & Deliverables

### Weekly Deliverables
Each week, teams will complete specific worksheets applying that session's concepts to their venture. These build cumulatively toward your final pitch.

| Session | Deliverable |
|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Market Segmentation Matrix + Beachhead Selection Justification |
| 2 | End User Profile + Persona Card + TAM Calculation |
| 3 | Full Life Cycle Use Case + Product Sketch + Value Proposition |
| 4 | Next 10 Customers List + Core Statement + Competitive Position Chart |

| 6 | Business Model Selection + Pricing Framework |
| 7 | LTV Calculation + COCA Estimate |
| 8 | Key Assumptions + Testing Plan + MVBP Definition |
| 9 | Product Roadmap + Pitch Deck Draft |

### DE Canvas
Teams will maintain a Disciplined Entrepreneurship Canvas throughout the course—a one-page visual summary of their venture across all 24 steps. This will be updated weekly and serve as the foundation for your final pitch.

### Final Pitches (May 4 & 11)
- **Format:** 8-minute presentation + 4-5 minutes Q&A + judge feedback
- **Teams per evening:** 2-3 teams present each night (5 teams total across two evenings)
- **Audience:** Panel of judges (entrepreneurs, investors, business professionals)
- **Requirements:**
  - Cover key elements of the DE framework
  - Demonstrate customer validation and research
  - Present viable business model with unit economics
  - **All team members must speak** during the presentation
- **Judge Feedback:** Real, constructive feedback from experienced professionals—this is a learning experience, not just an evaluation

## Grading Philosophy

This is a pass/fail course with emphasis on:

1. **Participation** - Active engagement in class discussions and team work
2. **Progress** - Consistent weekly deliverables showing learning progression
3. **Elevator Pitches** - Weekly improvement in pitch delivery and content
4. **Peer Feedback** - Honest, helpful feedback to other teams (this is critical!)
5. **Final Pitch** - Presentation demonstrates mastery of framework

### What We're Looking For

- **Evidence over opinion**: Show your work with data from customer research
- **Iteration**: Willingness to pivot when evidence suggests a different direction
- **Specificity**: Detailed, concrete thinking rather than vague generalities
- **Collaboration**: Effective teamwork and peer support

### What We're NOT Looking For

- A "successful" business idea (most won't be viable—that's normal!)
- Perfect execution (this is about learning the process)
- Brilliant solo performances (it's a team sport)

## A Note on Ideas

You do NOT need to come to this course with a business idea. In fact, coming in too attached to an idea can be counterproductive. We will spend the first sessions helping you identify problems worth solving and customers worth serving.

If you do have an idea, be prepared to:
- Test it rigorously against real customer feedback
- Pivot or abandon it if evidence suggests it won't work
- Learn just as much from the process as from the outcome

The goal is not to build the next billion-dollar company (though that would be nice). The goal is to learn a process you can apply throughout your life—whether starting a company, launching a project at work, or solving problems in your community.
