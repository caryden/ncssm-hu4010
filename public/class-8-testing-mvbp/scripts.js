  1: `Welcome to Class 8: Prove It. <break time="0.3s"/> Tonight we're covering Testing Assumptions and the Minimum Viable Business Product. <break time="0.3s"/> These are Steps 20, 21, 22, and 23 in the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework.`,

  2: `Welcome back from Spring Break! <break time="0.3s"/> Let's finish strong.`,

  3: `We're now in Theme 5 of the DE framework. <break time="0.5s"/> How Do You Design and Build? <break time="0.3s"/> This is where we shift from planning to proving.`,

  4: `There's a critical shift happening in your thinking. <break time="0.3s"/> Old thinking asks: "Can we build this?" <break time="0.5s"/> New thinking asks: "Will people pay for this?" <break time="0.5s"/> Build AFTER you validate, not before.`,

  5: `In 2007, Drew Houston had an idea. <break time="0.3s"/> The problem: files weren't synced across devices. The solution: automatic synchronization. The challenge: it was incredibly complex to build. <break time="0.3s"/> What would you do?`,

  6: `Instead of building, he tested. <break time="0.3s"/> He created a 3-minute demo video and posted it to Hacker News. <break time="0.5s"/> Overnight, the waitlist went from 5,000 to 75,000 signups. <break time="0.5s"/> No product existed. Just validation that people wanted it.`,

  7: `Tonight we'll learn to do what Drew did. <break time="0.3s"/> Identify what we're assuming. Test before we build. Define the Minimum Viable Business Product. And prove customers will actually pay.`,

  8: `Step 20: Identify Key Assumptions. <break time="0.3s"/> Everything you believe about your business is an assumption until you test it.`,

  9: `Here's a humbling truth. <break time="0.5s"/> Your business plan is a collection of beliefs. Until tested, they're just guesses. <break time="0.3s"/> The entrepreneurs who succeed are the ones who test their assumptions fastest.`,

  10: `What are you assuming? <break time="0.3s"/> There are five categories of assumptions. <break time="0.3s"/> Customer assumptions: "They have this problem." Value assumptions: "Our solution solves it." Product assumptions: "We can build this." Business assumptions: "This pricing works." And competition assumptions: "We can win." <break time="0.3s"/> Every one of these is a guess until tested.`,

  11: `You need to challenge everything. <break time="0.3s"/> When you think "they have this problem," ask yourself: have you witnessed it? When you believe "they'll pay X dollars," ask: have they paid for similar solutions? When you assume "we can build this," ask: do you have the skills? When you think "we can reach them," ask: have you actually tried? <break time="0.3s"/> Be your own harshest critic.`,

  12: `Not all assumptions are equal. You need to prioritize what to test. <break time="0.3s"/> High importance plus low certainty equals TEST NOW—these are high risk. High importance plus high certainty means monitor—keep watching but don't stress. Low importance plus low certainty means test later—when you have time. Low importance plus high certainty? Ignore—don't worry about these. <break time="0.5s"/> Focus on the upper left: high risk means high importance times low certainty.`,

  13: `Let me give you an example with a food delivery app. <break time="0.3s"/> "People will pay a $5 delivery fee"—high importance, low certainty. Test it. "Drivers will be available"—high importance, low certainty. Test it. "Restaurants will partner"—high importance but medium certainty. Keep watching. "We can build the app"—medium importance but high certainty. Don't worry about this one yet.`,

  14: `Your turn. <break time="0.3s"/> Take 15 minutes to identify your assumptions. List them, rate their importance and certainty, and prioritize which ones to test first.`,

  15: `Step 21: Test Key Assumptions. <break time="0.3s"/> Now let's learn how to design experiments that actually prove something.`,

  16: `Good experiments share four qualities. <break time="0.3s"/> They're Fast—days or weeks, not months. They're Cheap—minimal resources required. They're Decisive—clear pass or fail criteria. And they're Measurable—you define the success metric before you run the test.`,

  17: `You have a testing toolkit available to you. <break time="0.3s"/> Low effort options: landing pages, customer interviews, and smoke tests or fake doors. Medium effort: wizard of oz and prototypes. High effort: concierge MVP where you deliver the full service manually. <break time="0.3s"/> Start with low effort and work your way up.`,

  18: `The landing page test is one of the simplest. <break time="0.3s"/> Build a page describing your product, drive traffic to it, and measure the response. <break time="0.3s"/> This tests whether there's interest and whether your message resonates. <break time="0.3s"/> Key metrics: signup rate, engagement, and time on page.`,

  19: `The smoke test, or fake door test, goes further. <break time="0.3s"/> You create a "Buy Now" button that doesn't actually work. When someone clicks, you apologize and explain you're testing interest. <break time="0.5s"/> This tests whether people will actually try to buy, not just whether they're curious. <break time="0.3s"/> The key metric is click-through rate on the purchase button. <break time="0.3s"/> Always be ethical: apologize and explain the test afterward.`,

  20: `The Wizard of Oz test is powerful for complex products. <break time="0.3s"/> Customers think it's automated, but you're doing everything manually behind the scenes. <break time="0.5s"/> Famous example: Zappos. The founder posted shoe photos online. When someone ordered, he went to the store, bought the shoes, and shipped them himself. <break time="0.3s"/> This proved people WILL buy shoes online—before building any technology.`,

  21: `Here's a crucial principle. <break time="0.5s"/> Pre-define what success looks like. <break time="0.3s"/> "If 5 percent of landing page visitors sign up... proceed." "If 3 out of 10 interviewees mention the problem unprompted... it's real." "If 2 percent click 'Buy Now'... there's demand." <break time="0.5s"/> Decide BEFORE you test what constitutes success. Otherwise you'll rationalize any result.`,

  22: `Your turn again. <break time="0.3s"/> 15 minutes to design your tests. Pick your technique, design the experiment, define the success metric, and set your threshold. <break time="0.3s"/> Be specific.`,

  23: `Steps 22 and 23: Define MVBP and Prove It. <break time="0.3s"/> Now let's talk about what you actually need to build.`,

  24: `There's an important distinction between MVP and MVBP. <break time="0.3s"/> MVP—Minimum Viable Product—is the minimum product that works. It tests "can we build it?" It may be free. It validates technology. <break time="0.5s"/> MVBP—Minimum Viable Business Product—is the minimum product people PAY for. It tests "will they BUY it?" It requires a transaction. It validates the business. <break time="0.5s"/> MVBP is the real goal. Technology that works but nobody pays for is just an expensive hobby.`,

  25: `The MVBP test requires three things. <break time="0.3s"/> Value: the customer gets real value from your product. Payment: money actually changes hands. And Feedback: you learn something from the transaction. <break time="0.5s"/> All three are required. Without value, they won't pay again. Without payment, you haven't validated the business. Without feedback, you can't improve.`,

  26: `Let's look at famous MVBPs. <break time="0.3s"/> Dropbox: a video and a waitlist proved demand existed. Zappos: photos and manual fulfillment proved online shoe buying. Groupon: a blog and PDF coupons proved local deals work. Airbnb: the founders renting their own apartment proved strangers would stay in someone's home. <break time="0.5s"/> None of these were fully built products. They were experiments that validated businesses.`,

  27: `Here's the ultimate test. <break time="0.5s"/> You haven't validated until strangers pay you real money. <break time="0.5s"/> Not friends. Not family. Not "I would definitely buy that." <break time="0.3s"/> Strangers. Real money. That's validation.`,

  28: `Think of validation as a ladder. <break time="0.3s"/> At the bottom: someone says "that's interesting." Worth almost nothing. One step up: "tell me more." Still just curiosity. Then "I would buy that"—that's intent, but still cheap. "Email me when ready"—now there's commitment. "Here's a deposit"—we're getting somewhere. "Take my money"—that's a purchase. And at the top: "I'm renewing"—that's the gold standard. <break time="0.5s"/> Your goal is to get to PAYMENT as fast as possible.`,

  29: `Here's a template for defining your MVBP. <break time="0.3s"/> "Our MVBP is [what] that [delivers this value] for [this price] and teaches us [this feedback]." <break time="0.5s"/> Example: "Our MVBP is a manual tutoring matching service that connects students with tutors for $10 per session and teaches us which subjects are most requested."`,

  30: `With this class, we've completed Theme 5: How do you design and build? <break time="0.3s"/> You now know how to identify assumptions, test them quickly and cheaply, and define the smallest product that proves your business works.`,

  31: `Let's recap what to remember. <break time="0.3s"/> Every business is built on assumptions—identify yours. High importance plus low certainty equals test first. MVBP requires value plus payment plus feedback. And talk is cheap—payment is the only real validation.`,

  32: `Before next week. <break time="0.3s"/> Complete your assumption matrix with your top 3 risky assumptions identified. Design a test for each risky assumption. Define your MVBP using the template. Run at least one test if possible—don't wait. And read chapter 24 from Disciplined Entrepreneurship and start your pitch preparation.`,

  33: `Next week we enter the final theme: How do you scale? <break time="0.3s"/> We'll cover growth strategy and pitch preparation. <break time="0.5s"/> Remember: final pitches are in just two weeks! <break time="0.3s"/> See you then.`
