  1: `Welcome to Class 6: How Do You Make Money? <break time="0.3s"/> Tonight we're covering Business Model and Pricing Framework. <break time="0.3s"/> These are Steps 14, 15, and 16 in the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework.`,

  2: `We're now in Theme 4 of the DE framework. <break time="0.5s"/> How Do You Make Money? <break time="0.3s"/> You can build an amazing product, but if you can't capture value from it, you don't have a business.`,

  3: `Let me tell you about Adobe's gamble. <break time="0.3s"/> In 2013, Photoshop cost $699 as a one-time purchase. <break time="0.3s"/> "Buy the box"—that's how software had always been sold.`,

  4: `Then Adobe made a radical shift. <break time="0.5s"/> $9.99 per month for the Creative Cloud subscription. <break time="0.3s"/> Wall Street said they were crazy. Revenue would drop. Customers would revolt. <break time="0.3s"/> Everyone thought it was a mistake.`,

  5: `The result? <break time="0.5s"/> Adobe went from 4 billion in revenue to 19 billion. Stock up ten times. More customers than ever before. <break time="0.3s"/> The subscription model transformed the company.`,

  6: `Here's the lesson. <break time="0.5s"/> How you charge can be as innovative as what you sell. <break time="0.3s"/> Your business model is itself a strategic decision that can create or destroy competitive advantage.`,

  7: `Let's start with Step 14: TAM for Follow-on Markets. <break time="0.3s"/> Your beachhead is just the beginning.`,

  8: `Your Beachhead is Just the Beginning. <break time="0.3s"/> From your beachhead, you move to adjacent markets, then larger markets, and eventually the mass market. <break time="0.5s"/> Think of Amazon: books, then music, then everything, then AWS. <break time="0.3s"/> Each step built on the capabilities and reputation of the last.`,

  9: `What makes a good adjacent market? <break time="0.3s"/> Similar customer needs—the problem looks the same even if the industry is different. Shared technology or product capabilities—you can reuse what you built. Referenceable success—wins in the beachhead open doors. And logical expansion in the customer's mind—it makes sense that you'd be there.`,

  10: `Now Step 15: Design a Business Model. <break time="0.3s"/> This is about how you capture value from the value you create.`,

  11: `Your business model answers a fundamental question. <break time="0.5s"/> How do you capture value from the value you create? <break time="0.3s"/> Creating value isn't enough. You need a mechanism to turn that value into revenue.`,

  12: `There are eight common business models. <break time="0.3s"/> One-Time Sale: customer pays once, owns forever. Subscription: recurring payment for ongoing access. Freemium: basic product free, charge for premium features. Marketplace: connect buyers and sellers, take a cut. Razor and Blade: sell the base cheap, profit from consumables. Advertising: users get free access, advertisers pay. Licensing: others pay to use your intellectual property. And Usage-Based: charge based on consumption.`,

  13: `Let's compare One-Time Purchase versus Subscription. <break time="0.3s"/> One-Time: the customer pays once and owns forever. The pro is large upfront revenue. The con is you must constantly find new customers. <break time="0.5s"/> Subscription: recurring payment for ongoing access. The pro is predictable recurring revenue. The con is you must continuously deliver value to prevent churn. <break time="0.3s"/> Adobe proved subscription can work even for products people thought they wanted to own.`,

  14: `Freemium is a powerful model when done right. <break time="0.3s"/> You offer a basic product for free and charge for premium features. <break time="0.3s"/> Dropbox, Spotify, and LinkedIn all use this model. <break time="0.3s"/> The free tier acquires users. The premium tier monetizes power users. The challenge is finding the right balance of free versus paid features.`,

  15: `Marketplace models connect buyers and sellers and take a cut of each transaction. <break time="0.3s"/> Uber, Airbnb, and eBay are marketplace businesses. <break time="0.3s"/> They capture value on both sides of the transaction. <break time="0.3s"/> The challenge is the chicken-and-egg problem: you need buyers to attract sellers and sellers to attract buyers.`,

  16: `Now Step 16: Set Your Pricing Framework. <break time="0.3s"/> Pricing is one of the most important decisions you'll make.`,

  17: `There are three approaches to pricing. <break time="0.3s"/> Cost-Plus: your costs plus a markup. This sets your floor—the minimum you need to charge. <break time="0.5s"/> Competitive: based on what alternatives charge. This provides context for where you fit in the market. <break time="0.5s"/> Value-Based: based on the value you deliver to customers. This is your ceiling—the maximum you could charge. <break time="0.3s"/> Value-based pricing captures the most opportunity.`,

  18: `Remember the 10x Rule from earlier classes. <break time="0.5s"/> If you deliver a thousand dollars of value, you can charge a hundred. <break time="0.3s"/> Customers need to feel they're getting a deal. The gap between value and price is what makes the purchase feel like a no-brainer.`,

  19: `The Pricing Tiers pattern is powerful. <break time="0.3s"/> Basic tier: the entry point, lowest price. Pro tier: the most popular choice, middle price. Enterprise tier: full features, highest price. <break time="0.5s"/> The middle tier usually converts best. This is called the anchoring effect—the expensive option makes the middle option look reasonable.`,

  20: `Time for the workshop. <break time="0.3s"/> You have 25 minutes. <break time="0.5s"/> First eight minutes: map your follow-on markets after the beachhead. Next seven minutes: choose your business model and explain why. Final ten minutes: draft your pricing framework with tiers and rationale.`,

  21: `Let's recap what to remember. <break time="0.3s"/> Your beachhead leads to bigger markets—plan the path. Business model equals how you capture value—be intentional. Price based on value, not just cost. And remember that pricing is a hypothesis—test it with real customers.`,

  22: `Before next week. <break time="0.3s"/> Complete your follow-on market analysis for two to three markets. Write up your business model selection with clear rationale. Create a pricing framework with at least two or three tiers. And read chapters 17, 18, and 19 from Disciplined Entrepreneurship.`,

  23: `Next week we tackle Unit Economics. <break time="0.3s"/> We'll cover LTV, COCA, and The Crucial Ratio. <break time="0.3s"/> The question we'll answer: Will you actually make money on each customer? <break time="0.3s"/> See you then.`
