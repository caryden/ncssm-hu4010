  1: `Welcome to Class 7: Will You Make Money? <break time="0.3s"/> Tonight we're covering LTV, COCA, and the Crucial Ratio. <break time="0.3s"/> These are Steps 17, 18, and 19 in the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework.`,

  2: `Let's start with a fundamental truth. <break time="0.5s"/> A business isn't viable if it costs more to get a customer than that customer is worth. <break time="0.3s"/> This seems obvious, but you'd be amazed how many startups ignore it.`,

  3: `In 2019, WeWork seemed unstoppable. <break time="0.3s"/> 47 billion dollar valuation. Exponential growth. 700 plus locations. Glowing press coverage. <break time="0.3s"/> Everyone wanted to be like WeWork.`,

  4: `Then investors started looking at the unit economics. <break time="0.5s"/> Millions of dollars per location to build out. Five plus years to profitability. High churn rate. And the LTV to COCA ratio? <break time="0.3s"/> Negative. <break time="0.3s"/> They were losing money on every customer.`,

  5: `The collapse was spectacular. <break time="0.5s"/> 47 billion down to 9 billion. CEO fired. IPO cancelled. <break time="0.5s"/> The lesson? Growth means nothing without unit economics. <break time="0.3s"/> You can't scale your way out of losing money on each customer.`,

  6: `Tonight we'll calculate three things. <break time="0.3s"/> LTV: how much is a customer worth? COCA: how much does it cost to get one? And The Ratio: is this business actually viable? <break time="0.3s"/> Let's start with LTV.`,

  7: `Step 17: Calculate Lifetime Value. <break time="0.3s"/> This is the most important number in your business.`,

  8: `Customer Lifetime Value, or LTV, is the total profit from an average customer over your entire relationship with them. <break time="0.5s"/> Notice I said profit, not revenue. You need to account for your costs to serve them. <break time="0.3s"/> Think of it as: one customer leads to many dollars over time.`,

  9: `Why does LTV matter? <break time="0.3s"/> It tells you how much you can afford to spend acquiring customers. It tells you whether customers are valuable enough to sustain a business. And it shows you why retention is so important.`,

  10: `Here's the LTV formula. <break time="0.3s"/> LTV equals ARPU times Gross Margin times Lifespan. <break time="0.5s"/> ARPU is your average revenue per user. Gross Margin is revenue minus your costs to serve. And Lifespan is how long customers stay with you on average.`,

  11: `Let's break down ARPU—Average Revenue Per User. <break time="0.3s"/> What does the average customer pay per month or per year? <break time="0.3s"/> This includes base subscription or purchase, upsells and add-ons, expansion revenue over time, and recurring purchases. <break time="0.3s"/> Use realistic averages, not best-case scenarios.`,

  12: `Gross Margin is revenue minus the direct costs to serve each customer. <break time="0.3s"/> This includes hosting and infrastructure, customer support costs, payment processing fees typically 2 to 3 percent, and cost of goods sold for physical products. <break time="0.3s"/> Typical gross margin for SaaS is 60 to 80 percent. It's lower for physical products.`,

  13: `Customer Lifespan is how many months the average customer stays before churning. <break time="0.3s"/> There's a simple formula: Lifespan equals 1 divided by your monthly churn rate. <break time="0.5s"/> For example, if you have 5 percent monthly churn, your average lifespan is 20 months. <break time="0.3s"/> The math is elegant and important.`,

  14: `Here's why retention matters so much. <break time="0.3s"/> Small changes in churn create huge changes in LTV. <break time="0.5s"/> At $50 ARPU and 70 percent margin: 10 percent monthly churn gives you a 10 month lifespan and $350 LTV. 5 percent monthly churn gives you 20 months and $700 LTV. And 2 percent monthly churn gives you 50 months and $1,750 LTV. <break time="0.5s"/> Retention is everything.`,

  15: `Let's work through a complete example. <break time="0.3s"/> ARPU is $50 per month. Gross Margin is 70 percent. Monthly Churn is 5 percent. Lifespan is 1 divided by 0.05, which equals 20 months. <break time="0.5s"/> LTV equals $50 times 0.70 times 20, which equals $700. <break time="0.3s"/> Each customer is worth $700 to your business.`,

  16: `Now it's your turn. <break time="0.3s"/> You have 15 minutes to calculate your own LTV. <break time="0.3s"/> Document your ARPU, your Margin, your expected Lifespan, and calculate your LTV.`,

  17: `Steps 18 and 19: Sales Process and COCA. <break time="0.3s"/> Now let's figure out what it costs to acquire those customers.`,

  18: `Understanding your sales process means mapping the funnel. <break time="0.3s"/> You start with leads—everyone who shows interest. They become qualified leads. Some request a demo or start a trial. Some receive a proposal. And finally, some close and become customers. <break time="0.3s"/> At each stage, people drop out. That's normal. You need to know your conversion rates.`,

  19: `You can work backwards from your goals. <break time="0.3s"/> Say you want 20 customers per month. If your close rate is 6 percent of leads, then you need 333 leads per month. <break time="0.5s"/> This tells you what marketing must deliver. It also tells you if your goal is realistic given your resources.`,

  20: `COCA stands for Cost of Customer Acquisition. <break time="0.3s"/> It's the total cost to acquire one new paying customer. <break time="0.5s"/> The formula is simple: Marketing plus Sales costs, divided by the number of customers acquired. <break time="0.3s"/> Money goes in, customers come out.`,

  21: `What goes into COCA? <break time="0.3s"/> On the marketing side: paid ads, content creation, events and sponsorships, marketing tools, and marketing salaries. <break time="0.3s"/> On the sales side: sales salaries, commissions, travel and meetings, CRM and tools, and sales enablement materials. <break time="0.5s"/> And don't forget founder time—that's often the biggest hidden cost.`,

  22: `Let's talk about founder time. <break time="0.3s"/> If you spend 20 hours per week selling, that has a real cost. <break time="0.3s"/> 20 hours times $100 per hour opportunity cost equals $2,000 per week. That's $8,000 per month in founder sales cost. <break time="0.5s"/> Most founders undercount this. Don't make that mistake.`,

  23: `Here's an example COCA calculation. <break time="0.3s"/> Paid ads: $3,000. Content creation: $1,000. Founder time: $4,000. Tools and software: $500. Total: $8,500 per month. <break time="0.5s"/> If you acquire 10 customers per month, your COCA is $850 per customer.`,

  24: `Your turn again. <break time="0.3s"/> 10 minutes to calculate your COCA. <break time="0.3s"/> List all your costs, project your customer acquisition, and calculate your COCA. Remember to include founder time.`,

  25: `Now the moment of truth. <break time="0.5s"/> LTV divided by COCA should be greater than 3. <break time="0.5s"/> Your Lifetime Value should be at least three times your Cost of Customer Acquisition. <break time="0.3s"/> This gives you room for profitability and growth.`,

  26: `Let's interpret what different ratios mean. <break time="0.3s"/> Below 1 is crisis mode—you're losing money on every customer. 1 to 2 is danger zone—barely breaking even. 2 to 3 is caution territory—you might survive but growth is hard. 3 to 5 is healthy—this is where you want to be. And above 5 is strong—you have room to invest aggressively. <break time="0.5s"/> Target 3x or higher.`,

  27: `If your ratio is bad, you have two sets of levers. <break time="0.3s"/> To increase LTV: raise prices, reduce churn, add upsells, or cut serving costs. <break time="0.3s"/> To decrease COCA: find cheaper channels, improve conversion rates, generate referrals and virality, or shorten your sales cycle. <break time="0.3s"/> Pick the levers that make sense for your business.`,

  28: `Of all these levers, retention is usually the biggest one. <break time="0.5s"/> Cutting churn from 5 percent to 3 percent increases LTV by 67 percent. <break time="0.5s"/> The same effort on other levers typically yields smaller impact. <break time="0.3s"/> Focus on keeping customers. It's almost always the highest-leverage activity.`,

  29: `Let's compare two companies that faced opposite fates. <break time="0.3s"/> WeWork had high COCA from real estate and buildout costs. Uncertain LTV because of high churn. Their ratio was less than 1. Result: collapse. <break time="0.5s"/> Zoom had low COCA from viral spread and free trials. High LTV from sticky, expanding accounts. Their ratio was around 8x. Result: over 100 billion dollar company. <break time="0.3s"/> Unit economics determine destiny.`,

  30: `With this class, we've completed Theme 4: How do you make money? <break time="0.3s"/> We've covered pricing strategy, Lifetime Value, Cost of Customer Acquisition, and unit economics. <break time="0.3s"/> You now have the tools to answer whether your business can be profitable.`,

  31: `Let's recap what to remember. <break time="0.3s"/> LTV is the value of a customer—profit, not revenue. COCA is the cost to acquire a customer—include ALL costs, especially founder time. LTV divided by COCA should be greater than 3 for a healthy business. And retention is usually your biggest lever for improvement.`,

  32: `Before next week. <break time="0.3s"/> Complete your LTV calculation with documented assumptions. Do a full COCA breakdown—don't forget founder time. If your ratio is less than 3, create an improvement plan. And read chapters 20 through 23 from Disciplined Entrepreneurship on Testing and MVBP.`,

  33: `Next week we enter Theme 5: How do you design and build? <break time="0.3s"/> We'll cover Testing Assumptions and the Minimum Viable Business Product. <break time="0.3s"/> The questions we'll answer: What do you still need to prove? And what's the smallest thing you can build to test your hypothesis? <break time="0.3s"/> See you then.`
