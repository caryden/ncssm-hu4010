  1: `Welcome to Class 2: Know Your Customer. <break time="0.3s"/> Tonight we're covering the End User Profile, calculating your Total Addressable Market, and building a customer persona. <break time="0.3s"/> These are Steps 3, 4, and 5 in the Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework.`,

  2: `Here's a story that plays out far too often. <break time="0.5s"/> They built for 18 months without talking to customers. <break time="0.5s"/> Engineers and founders convinced they knew exactly what the market needed. <break time="0.5s"/> Building in isolation. Trusting their assumptions.`,

  3: `Nobody wanted it. <break time="0.5s"/> Eighteen months of work. Team exhausted. Money spent. <break time="0.5s"/> And when they finally showed it to customers? Silence. <break time="0.5s"/> The product solved a problem nobody actually had.`,

  4: `Bill Aulet captures the essential mindset for customer research. <break time="0.5s"/> "The goal of primary market research is not to sell, but to learn." <break time="0.5s"/> This is crucial. When you talk to customers, you're not pitching. You're listening. You're discovering what's really going on in their world.`,

  5: `Tonight's journey takes us from broad to specific. <break time="0.3s"/> We start with a market segment, then narrow down to a user profile, and finally arrive at a single, vivid persona. <break time="0.3s"/> The more specific you get, the better your decisions will be.`,

  6: `Let's start with Step 3: Build an End User Profile. <break time="0.3s"/> This is about understanding who will actually use your product day-to-day.`,

  7: `Here's a critical distinction many founders miss. <break time="0.3s"/> The end user and the buyer are often different people. <break time="0.5s"/> In consumer apps, they're usually the same. But in enterprise software, the employee uses it while the IT director buys it. For kids' games, children play while parents pay. <break time="0.3s"/> Design for the user. Sell to the buyer.`,

  8: `What do you need to know about your end user? <break time="0.3s"/> Five categories. <break time="0.3s"/> Demographics: who they are. Psychographics: what they value. Behaviors: what they actually do. Context: where and when the problem occurs. And current solutions: what they're doing today to solve this problem.`,

  9: `These are the questions you'll answer through research. <break time="0.3s"/> What does a typical day look like for this person? Where does the problem occur? How do they solve it today? What frustrates them about their current solutions? And what would "better" actually look like to them?`,

  10: `Here's a rule that will transform your customer conversations. <break time="0.5s"/> The 80/20 Rule. <break time="0.3s"/> Listen 80 percent of the time. Talk only 20 percent. <break time="0.3s"/> You're there to learn, not to sell. The moment you start pitching, you stop learning.`,

  11: `Let's look at interview best practices. <break time="0.3s"/> Do ask open-ended questions. Focus on past behavior, not hypotheticals. Ask "why" repeatedly. Take detailed notes. <break time="0.5s"/> Don't pitch your solution. Don't ask leading questions. Don't accept hypothetical answers like "I would definitely use that." And don't assume you understand—keep probing.`,

  12: `Here's a framework you can use in every customer interview. <break time="0.3s"/> Start with: "Tell me about the last time you experienced this problem." Then: "What did you do about it?" Then: "How did that work out?" Then: "What would make it better?" And finally: "How much time or money does this cost you?" <break time="0.3s"/> Notice these are all about past behavior and concrete details.`,

  13: `Now let's move to Step 4: Calculate TAM. <break time="0.3s"/> TAM stands for Total Addressable Market.`,

  14: `Total Addressable Market is the total revenue you would earn if you owned 100 percent of your beachhead market. <break time="0.5s"/> It's your ceiling for this particular market segment. Not the whole world. Just your beachhead.`,

  15: `Why does TAM matter? <break time="0.3s"/> It tells you if this market is worth pursuing. It shows you the ceiling for this opportunity. It helps you understand if you'll need to expand to adjacent markets. And it keeps your goals realistic.`,

  16: `The formula is simple. <break time="0.3s"/> Number of potential customers times revenue per customer equals your TAM. <break time="0.5s"/> Count them. Price it. Multiply. <break time="0.3s"/> Use real numbers, not guesses.`,

  17: `Here's an example. <break time="0.3s"/> Say your beachhead is Durham restaurants, and your product is a subscription service at $200 per month. <break time="0.3s"/> 200 restaurants times $2,400 per year equals a TAM of $480,000. <break time="0.5s"/> Is that big enough? It depends on your goals and your team size.`,

  18: `Think about TAM like Goldilocks. <break time="0.3s"/> Too small, less than a million dollars, may not be worth pursuing. <break time="0.3s"/> Just right, somewhere between 5 and 50 million, is the beachhead sweet spot. <break time="0.3s"/> Too big, over 100 million? Ask yourself: are you being specific enough about your beachhead?`,

  19: `Here's a critical question for your TAM calculation. <break time="0.5s"/> What assumptions does your TAM depend on? <break time="0.3s"/> Write them down. Test them. <break time="0.3s"/> Your TAM is only as reliable as the assumptions underneath it.`,

  20: `Now we reach Step 5: Profile the Persona. <break time="0.3s"/> This is where we turn data into a person.`,

  21: `We're making it real. <break time="0.3s"/> Moving from data categories to a real person you can picture. <break time="0.3s"/> "Females 25-35" becomes "Maria." <break time="0.3s"/> A demographic becomes a human being with a name, a face, and a story.`,

  22: `Why create a persona? <break time="0.3s"/> It's easier to design for "Maria" than for "females 25-35." A persona creates shared understanding across your team. It enables empathy-driven decisions. And it keeps you honest about who you're actually serving.`,

  23: `Meet Maria Chen. <break time="0.3s"/> She's 32, a product manager in Austin making 95K a year. <break time="0.3s"/> Her quote: "I waste hours every week on tasks that should be automated." <break time="0.3s"/> Her goals: ship products faster, reduce time in meetings, prove her impact with data. Her frustrations: manual reporting takes hours, constant context switching, no single source of truth. Her current solution: spreadsheets, Slack, and prayer.`,

  24: `The most important element of your persona? <break time="0.5s"/> The quote. What would your persona actually say? <break time="0.3s"/> "I just want something that works." <break time="0.3s"/> This quote should come from real customer research. It captures their frustration in their own words.`,

  25: `Here's the test. <break time="0.5s"/> Would THIS person buy your product? <break time="0.3s"/> Not "people like this." This specific person. Maria. <break time="0.5s"/> If you can't answer confidently, you need more research.`,

  26: `One more rule. <break time="0.5s"/> One persona. Not three. Not five. One. <break time="0.5s"/> Pick the customer who represents your best opportunity. <break time="0.3s"/> You can always expand later. But right now, focus on one.`,

  27: `Time for the workshop. <break time="0.3s"/> You have 20 minutes to build your persona. <break time="0.3s"/> Start by naming them. Then fill in demographics. Write their quote—this is crucial. Add their goals and frustrations. And document their current solution. <break time="0.3s"/> Go.`,

  28: `Let's recap what to remember. <break time="0.3s"/> Your end user is specific, not generic. TAM must be calculated, not guessed. Your persona should feel like a real person you could have coffee with. And research trumps assumptions. Always.`,

  29: `Before next week. <break time="0.3s"/> Finalize your persona with all fields complete and bring a printed copy. Complete your TAM calculation and show your work. Have two more customer conversations. And read chapters 6 and 8 from Disciplined Entrepreneurship.`,

  30: `Next week we tackle Value Proposition. <break time="0.3s"/> We'll cover the Full Life Cycle Use Case and Quantified Value Proposition. <break time="0.3s"/> The question we'll answer: What can you do for your customer that no one else can? <break time="0.3s"/> See you then.`
