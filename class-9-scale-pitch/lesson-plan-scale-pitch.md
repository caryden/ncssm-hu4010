## Key Concepts

### Product Plan / Scale (Step 24)
The roadmap for growing beyond your initial beachhead market.

**The Expansion Framework:**
1. Dominate the beachhead first
2. Identify adjacent markets with similar needs
3. Sequence expansion based on:
   - Market readiness
   - Product capability
   - Reference customers
   - Team capacity

**Product Roadmap Elements:**
- **Phase 1:** Beachhead features (now)
- **Phase 2:** Features for adjacent market #1 (6-12 months)
- **Phase 3:** Features for adjacent market #2 (12-24 months)
- **Platform/General:** Features that serve all markets (ongoing)

### The Pitch Structure
A proven framework for presenting your venture:

1. **Hook** (30 sec): Grab attention with the problem
2. **Problem** (1 min): Paint the pain vividly
3. **Solution** (1 min): Your unique approach
4. **Market** (1 min): Size and beachhead strategy
5. **Business Model** (1 min): How you make money
6. **Traction/Validation** (1 min): What you've proven
7. **Team** (30 sec): Why you can win
8. **Ask** (30 sec): What you need next
9. **Close** (30 sec): Memorable ending

**Total: 8 minutes** (leaves 4 min for Q&A)

### Part 1: Scaling Strategy (25 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (12 min)

**The Scaling Mindset:**

You've designed for a beachhead. Now think about growth.

**The Sequence:**
```
Beachhead → Adjacent #1 → Adjacent #2 → Broader Market
```

**Why Sequence Matters:**
- Resources are limited
- Each market teaches you something
- Success builds credibility for next market
- Product evolves to serve broader needs

**Choosing Next Markets:**

| Factor | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Similarity** | How similar are customer needs? |
| **References** | Can beachhead customers refer you? |
| **Product fit** | How much must the product change? |
| **Go-to-market** | Can you use same channels? |
| **Competition** | Who else serves this market? |

**Product Roadmap Logic:**

| Phase | Market | Features | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Beachhead | Core solution | Now |
| 2 | Adjacent #1 | + Enhancements for new segment | 6-12 mo |
| 3 | Adjacent #2 | + Further expansion features | 12-24 mo |

**Example: Slack's Expansion:**
1. Internal team (Tiny Speck gaming company)
2. Tech startups (similar culture)
3. Tech companies (larger, similar needs)
4. Enterprise (different needs, different product)
5. Everyone (platform play)

Each step built on the last.

#### Scale Planning Exercise (13 min)

Teams develop their expansion plan:

1. **Confirm beachhead** (3 min)
   - Who is it? How big?
   - What features do they need?

2. **Identify adjacent markets** (5 min)
   - List 2-3 logical next markets
   - Why are they adjacent?

3. **Sequence expansion** (4 min)
   - Which comes first? Why?
   - What product changes needed?

4. **Draft roadmap** (3 min)
   - Phase 1: [Beachhead features]
   - Phase 2: [First expansion]
   - Phase 3: [Second expansion]

### Part 2: Pitch Structure (25 minutes)

#### The Pitch Framework (12 min)

**8 Minutes to Win:**

Your pitch needs to tell a complete, compelling story in 8 minutes.

**The Structure:**

| Section | Time | Purpose | Key Content |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Hook** | 30s | Grab attention | Provocative question, surprising stat, or story |
| **Problem** | 60s | Create empathy | Who has this problem? How painful is it? |
| **Solution** | 60s | Show the answer | What do you do? How does it work? |
| **Market** | 60s | Show opportunity | TAM, beachhead, expansion path |
| **Business Model** | 60s | Show viability | How you charge, unit economics |
| **Traction** | 60s | Prove it works | Validation, customer feedback, tests |
| **Team** | 30s | Build confidence | Why you can execute |
| **Ask** | 30s | Be specific | What you need next |
| **Close** | 30s | Be memorable | Return to hook, vision |

**Pro Tips:**

1. **Start strong:** First 30 seconds determine whether people listen
2. **Tell stories:** "Let me tell you about Maria..." not "Our target demographic is..."
3. **Show, don't tell:** Demos > Descriptions
4. **Use numbers:** Specific > Vague ($500K TAM, not "huge market")
5. **Practice transitions:** Smooth flow between sections
6. **Nail the close:** Last impression matters as much as first

#### Pitch Components Deep Dive (13 min)

**The Hook:**
- Start with the problem, not your company
- Provocative question: "What if I told you..."
- Surprising stat: "Every day, [X] people struggle with..."
- Brief story: "Last week, I met someone who..."

**The Problem:**
- Make it vivid and relatable
- Use your persona: "Meet Maria. She's a..."
- Quantify the pain: Time wasted, money lost, opportunities missed
- Current solutions and why they fail

**The Solution:**
- What you do in one sentence
- How it works (simple explanation)
- Brief demo or visual if possible
- Key differentiator

**Traction/Validation:**
- Customer conversations and feedback
- Tests run and results
- Early users or commitments
- What you've learned and how you've pivoted

**The Ask:**
- For this class: "Here's what we need to move forward..."
- Be specific: "We're looking for 5 pilot customers in Durham restaurants"
- Show next steps: "In the next 3 months, we plan to..."

### Part 3: Pitch Workshop & Practice (20 minutes)

#### Pitch Development (12 min)

Teams work on their pitches:

1. **Outline** (6 min)
   - Fill in each section with key points
   - Decide who presents what (all must participate)

2. **Storytelling** (4 min)
   - Craft your hook
   - Write your problem story

3. **Timing** (2 min)
   - Rough time check for each section

#### Practice Round (8 min)

2-3 teams do a quick 2-minute pitch preview:
- Hook + Problem + Solution

Quick feedback from peers:
- What's strongest?
- What needs work before finals?

---

### Part 4: Final Prep (10 minutes)

#### Pitch Day Logistics (5 min)
- May 4 & 11: Final presentations
- 8 minutes + 4 minutes Q&A per team
- Panel of judges (introduce who if known)
- Order will be announced

#### Preparing for Questions (5 min)

**Anticipate tough questions:**
- "What if a competitor copies you?"
- "How do you know customers will pay?"
- "Why can YOU do this?"
- "What's your biggest risk?"
- "How did you get these numbers?"

**Answering techniques:**
- Listen fully before responding
- It's okay to say "We don't know yet, but..."
- Bridge to your strengths
- Be honest about uncertainties
