# Class 4: Competitive Positioning & Core

**Date:** March 2, 2025
**Duration:** 100 minutes (6:15 - 7:55 PM)
**DE Steps:** 9 (Next 10 Customers), 10 (Define Your Core), 11 (Chart Competitive Position)

---

## Session Overview

With a clear understanding of customer needs and value proposition, students now turn outward to understand the competitive landscape. This session covers finding validation through real potential customers, defining what makes your venture uniquely positioned to win, and mapping your position against alternatives. The key shift: from internal focus to external reality check.

Key insight: **Your "core" isn't what you do—it's what you do that's nearly impossible for others to copy.**

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** 10 potential customers who fit their persona and could become early adopters
2. **Define** their venture's "core"—the sustainable competitive advantage
3. **Map** competitive position against alternatives (direct and indirect)
4. **Articulate** why they can win against competitors
5. **Recognize** the difference between features and defensible advantages

---

## Key Concepts

### Next 10 Customers (Step 9)
Identify 10 real, specific potential customers who:
- Match your persona profile
- Have the problem you're solving
- Could realistically become paying customers
- Are accessible to you now

**Why 10?**
- Forces specificity (can't hide behind "the market")
- Provides validation targets
- Creates urgency to test assumptions
- Builds early customer pipeline

### Defining Your Core (Step 10)
Your "core" is your sustainable competitive advantage—the thing that makes you uniquely positioned to win AND is hard for others to replicate.

**Types of Core:**
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Network Effects** | Value increases with users | Facebook, Uber |
| **Proprietary Tech** | Unique technology/IP | Tesla batteries, Google algorithm |
| **Cost Advantage** | Structural cost leadership | Walmart, Amazon |
| **Customer Lock-in** | High switching costs | Salesforce, enterprise software |
| **Unique Expertise** | Specialized knowledge | Specialized consultants |
| **Access/Relationships** | Exclusive partnerships | Exclusive distribution |
| **Brand** | Strong identity/loyalty | Apple, Nike |
| **Data** | Proprietary data assets | Credit bureaus, Bloomberg |

**Warning:** Features are NOT core. Features can be copied. Core cannot (easily).

### Competitive Position (Step 11)
A visual map showing where you stand relative to alternatives—both direct competitors and substitute solutions.

**2x2 Matrix Format:**
- Choose two axes that matter most to your customer
- Plot yourself and competitors
- Identify the "white space" or your unique position

## Session Outline

### Weekly Elevator Pitches (15 minutes)

#### Format
- **Each team:** 2 min pitch + 1 min feedback
- **This week's focus:** Problem + solution + value proposition
- **Feedback from:** Instructor and peers

#### Guiding Questions for Feedback
- Is the value proposition specific and measurable?
- Do I understand how the solution works?
- What evidence supports the value claim?

---

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Hook: The Apple vs. Dell Story (7 min)
In the 2000s, Dell was the world's largest PC maker. Efficient supply chain, direct sales model, great margins. They could build a computer cheaper than anyone.

Then came Apple with the iPhone. Within a decade:
- Dell is a shadow of its former self
- Apple is the most valuable company on Earth

What happened? Dell's "core" (supply chain efficiency) was:
1. Copiable (others could do it)
2. Disrupted (the market changed)

Apple's core (design + ecosystem + brand) was:
1. Hard to copy (requires different DNA)
2. Self-reinforcing (ecosystem creates lock-in)

**Discussion:** What's Google's core? Amazon's? A local restaurant's?

#### Homework Review (5 min)
- How did value quantification go?
- Any surprising numbers?
- Did the journey map reveal new insights?

---

### Part 1: Your Next 10 Customers (25 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (10 min)

**Why 10 Specific People?**

It's easy to say "restaurant owners would want this." It's harder to say "here are 10 restaurant owners by name who have this problem and would talk to me."

**The 10 Customer Criteria:**
1. Match your persona (demographics, psychographics)
2. Have the problem (demonstrated, not assumed)
3. Are accessible (you can reach them)
4. Are early adopter types (willing to try new things)
5. Could become paying customers (have budget, authority)

**Where to Find Them:**
- Personal network (friends, family, their connections)
- LinkedIn and professional networks
- Industry events and meetups
- Online communities (Reddit, Discord, forums)
- Cold outreach (harder but possible)

**The "First Degree" Advantage:**
Customers connected to you by one degree are far more accessible. Map your network.

#### Identification Exercise (15 min)

Teams work to identify their 10 customers:

1. **Network mapping** (5 min)
   - Who do you know who might be in your target segment?
   - Who do you know who KNOWS people in your segment?

2. **List building** (5 min)
   - Write down 10 names (or roles if you don't know names yet)
   - Note how you'd reach each one

3. **Accessibility assessment** (5 min)
   - Rank by accessibility (1-3)
   - Identify your first 3 outreach targets

### Part 2: Define Your Core (30 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (15 min)

**What Is "Core"?**

Your core is the ONE thing you do better than anyone else that is also defensible over time.

**The Test:**
- Is it valuable to customers? (They care about it)
- Is it rare? (Not everyone has it)
- Is it hard to copy? (Requires time, money, or unique capability)
- Is it yours to leverage? (You can build on it)

**Core vs. Features:**

| Features (Not Core) | Core (Defensible) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Fast delivery" | Proprietary logistics network |
| "Easy to use" | Deep UX research team + methodology |
| "Great customer service" | Community-driven support model |
| "Best price" | Structural cost advantage (not just accepting lower margins) |

**Finding Your Core:**

Ask these questions:
1. What do you know that others don't?
2. Who do you have access to that others don't?
3. What can you do that others can't (easily)?
4. What gets better the more you do it?

**Network Effects - The Holy Grail:**
Some cores create "flywheels" that reinforce themselves:
- More users → More data → Better product → More users
- More buyers → More sellers → Better marketplace → More buyers

#### Core Definition Workshop (15 min)

Teams work to identify their core:

1. **Brainstorm potential cores** (5 min)
   - What might be your defensible advantage?
   - Don't filter yet—list everything

2. **Apply the tests** (5 min)
   - For each candidate: Is it rare? Hard to copy? Valuable?
   - Eliminate features masquerading as core

3. **Draft core statement** (5 min)
   - "Our core is [X] because [it's rare/hard to copy/valuable]"

### Part 3: Competitive Positioning (25 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (10 min)

**The Competitive Landscape:**

Competitors come in two forms:
1. **Direct competitors:** Do the same thing for the same customers
2. **Indirect competitors/Substitutes:** Solve the same problem differently

**Never say "we have no competitors."** If customers have the problem, they're solving it somehow. Even "do nothing" or "manual workaround" is a competitor.

**The 2x2 Positioning Matrix:**

Choose two dimensions that:
- Matter most to your target customer
- Differentiate you from alternatives
- You can credibly claim to own

Plot all competitors (and yourself) on the matrix.

**Common Axes:**
- Price (low → high)
- Quality/Performance (low → high)
- Ease of use (complex → simple)
- Speed (slow → fast)
- Specialization (general → specialized)
- Support level (self-service → high-touch)

**Finding White Space:**
The ideal position is one where:
- No strong competitor exists
- Customers actually want to be served there
- You can credibly occupy it

#### Positioning Exercise (15 min)

Teams create their competitive position chart:

1. **List competitors** (5 min)
   - Direct: Who does something similar?
   - Indirect: What else solves this problem?
   - Don't forget "do nothing / status quo"

2. **Choose axes** (3 min)
   - What 2 dimensions matter most to your persona?
   - Make sure you differentiate on at least one

3. **Plot the map** (5 min)
   - Position each competitor
   - Position yourself
   - Identify your unique space

4. **Validate** (2 min)
   - Is there really white space?
   - Would customers value being served here?

---

### Break (10 minutes)

---

### Part 4: Integration & Share (15 minutes)

#### Synthesis (5 min)
Teams connect their work:
- How does your core create the position you want?
- Why can YOU occupy that white space?
- How would you explain this to a potential customer?

#### Share & Feedback (10 min)
2-3 teams present:
- Who are your first 3 target customers?
- What is your core (one sentence)?
- Show your competitive position map

Feedback questions:
- Is the core really defensible?
- Is the white space real?
- Are the 10 customers realistic?

---

### Closing (5 minutes)

#### Key Takeaways
1. Identify real, specific potential customers—not abstract segments
2. Your core is your defensible advantage, not your features
3. Map competition including substitutes and "do nothing"
4. Position yourself where customers want to be served

## Instructor Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize
- Specificity is everything—"10 customers" means actual people
- Core is strategic, not tactical
- Everyone has competitors (including "do nothing")

### Common Mistakes to Watch For
- Confusing features with core
- Unrealistic customer lists (people they can't actually reach)
- Competitive maps that avoid hard comparisons
- Claiming "no competitors" (always wrong)

### Facilitation Tips
- Push on "why is that hard to copy?"
- Ask teams to name actual names for customers
- Challenge positioning: "Why would a customer choose you over [competitor]?"
