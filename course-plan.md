## Course Philosophy

This course teaches entrepreneurship as a **learnable craft**, not an innate talent. Drawing from Bill Aulet's Disciplined Entrepreneurship framework developed at MIT, we reject the mythology of the "born entrepreneur" and instead embrace a systematic, repeatable process that any motivated student can master. The course recognizes that high-achieving NCSSM students may paradoxically self-exclude from entrepreneurship, believing they lack some mysterious entrepreneurial gene—our first task is dismantling this misconception.

The instructor serves as a **master craftsperson in an apprenticeship model**, not as a lecturer dispensing knowledge. Class sessions follow Kolb's experiential learning cycle: brief concept introduction followed by extended team application, with feedback loops through weekly elevator pitches. Learning happens through doing—through customer interviews, prototype sketches, pitch practice, and iterative refinement. The Wednesday work sessions with Chad Keister extend this hands-on time, and the instructor's role is to guide, challenge, and provide the "pattern recognition" that comes from entrepreneurial experience.

Students are **active practitioners**, not passive recipients. From Week 1, they work in teams on real problems they've identified, making decisions with incomplete information and learning from both successes and failures. The final pitch is not a test but a culmination—a chance to demonstrate the systematic thinking they've developed. We value the process (customer research, validated learning, disciplined iteration) over the outcome (whether the idea is "fundable"). A team that pivots three times based on customer feedback has learned more than a team that stubbornly clings to an unvalidated concept.

## Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: Customer First, Always

**Statement:** Every entrepreneurial decision begins with understanding who the customer is and what problem they actually have—not what we assume they have.

**Rationale:** Steve Blank's research shows 90%+ of startups fail due to lack of customers, not technology failures. The DE framework dedicates its first 5 steps (and first 2 classes) entirely to customer identification. This sequence is intentional: product attachment before customer understanding leads to "solution in search of a problem" syndrome.

**Implications:**
- Slide design: Customer stories and quotes appear before product descriptions; personas are visualized prominently
- Activities: Customer research homework assigned weekly; teams must document actual conversations, not assumptions
- Assessment: Evaluate quality of customer insights, not cleverness of product ideas

---

### Principle 2: Specificity Over Generality

**Statement:** Narrow focus beats broad ambition—the more specific the target customer, market, and value proposition, the more likely success becomes.

**Rationale:** The "beachhead market" concept from DE (Step 2) and examples like Facebook (Harvard only), Amazon (books only), and Instagram (iPhone photo filters only) demonstrate that dominating a small segment creates momentum for expansion. High schoolers often fall into "trillion-dollar market" thinking that sounds impressive but is strategically meaningless.

**Implications:**
- Slide design: Emphasize the "paradox of specificity"; show funnel narrowing from TAM to beachhead
- Activities: Push back on broad segment definitions ("college students" → "STEM majors at research universities struggling with lab equipment procurement")
- Assessment: Reward specificity; mark down vague customer definitions

---

### Principle 3: Evidence Over Opinion

**Statement:** Claims about customers, markets, and value must be supported by evidence from the real world, not assumptions or hopes.

**Rationale:** Blank's dictum "there are no facts inside your building" captures this principle. The scientific method applies to entrepreneurship: hypothesize, test, learn. Students naturally want to skip customer research and jump to building—resist this tendency.

**Implications:**
- Slide design: Include "How do you know?" prompts; visualize hypothesis → test → learn cycles
- Activities: Require documentation of customer conversations; ask "What evidence supports that?" in feedback
- Assessment: Evaluate rigor of validation, not confidence of assertions

---

### Principle 4: Iteration Over Perfection

**Statement:** Rapid learning through iteration beats slow pursuit of perfection—fail fast, learn quickly, improve continuously.

**Rationale:** The MVBP concept (Class 8) and Build-Measure-Learn loop (Eric Ries) formalize this. Entrepreneurship is inherently uncertain; the goal is reducing uncertainty as quickly as possible. Students trained in academic perfectionism need explicit permission to iterate.

**Implications:**
- Slide design: Show evolution of real products (e.g., early iPhone vs. current); normalize pivots
- Activities: Weekly elevator pitches create iteration rhythm; encourage visible changes week-over-week
- Assessment: Value demonstrated learning from failure over polished but unvalidated work

---

### Principle 5: Team Sport

**Statement:** Entrepreneurship requires collaboration—diverse teams outperform solo founders, and the skills developed in teamwork are as valuable as domain knowledge.

**Rationale:** Research shows 2-person teams outperform individuals; 3-person even better. Even our larger 6-person teams (constrained by final pitch logistics) provide essential practice in delegation, conflict resolution, and leveraging complementary skills.

**Implications:**
- Slide design: Avoid "genius founder" narratives; show team photos and credit shared work
- Activities: Self-assessment of skills during team formation; rotate pitch presenters; require all members to speak in final pitch
- Assessment: Evaluate team dynamics and collaboration, not just deliverables

---

### Principle 6: De-Risk Through Validation

**Statement:** Entrepreneurs don't embrace risk blindly—they systematically identify and reduce uncertainty through validation before committing resources.

**Rationale:** The misconception that entrepreneurs are gamblers prevents risk-averse students from seeing themselves as potential founders. The DE framework is explicitly about de-risking: each step validates assumptions before the next. "Calculated risk" replaces "reckless risk."

**Implications:**
- Slide design: Frame each DE step as reducing a specific uncertainty; show risk reduction over time
- Activities: Identify key assumptions explicitly; design tests for highest-risk assumptions first
- Assessment: Evaluate quality of assumption identification and testing, not boldness of vision

---

### Principle 7: Show, Then Tell

**Statement:** Concrete examples and visualizations precede abstract concepts—students understand frameworks better after seeing them applied to real cases.

**Rationale:** Kolb's "concrete experience" phase should precede "abstract conceptualization." Opening hooks with company stories (Instagram, Uber, etc.) ground the subsequent framework in memorable examples. D3 visualizations make abstract concepts (TAM, DMU, competitive positioning) tangible.

**Implications:**
- Slide design: Case study or story opens each concept section; visualizations animate to build understanding
- Activities: "What company does this remind you of?" discussions connect new concepts to known examples
- Assessment: Ask students to identify framework elements in new examples, not just recite definitions

## Learning Objectives Framework

### Taxonomy

We use modified Bloom's taxonomy levels, emphasizing higher-order skills appropriate for entrepreneurship:

| Level | Description | Course Emphasis |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Remember** | Recall facts and basic concepts | Low—vocabulary and framework names |
| **Understand** | Explain ideas and concepts | Medium—articulate why steps matter |
| **Apply** | Use information in new situations | High—apply DE steps to own venture |
| **Analyze** | Draw connections and identify patterns | High—analyze customer segments, competitive landscape |
| **Evaluate** | Justify decisions and positions | High—defend beachhead selection, business model choices |
| **Create** | Produce new work | Highest—create deliverables, pitch, and venture plan |

### Objective Writing Rules

1. Start with action verb from appropriate Bloom's level
2. Be specific and measurable (avoid "understand" alone—specify what understanding looks like)
3. One objective = one skill or capability
4. Match level to actual expectation for that session

**Preferred action verbs by level:**
- Apply: demonstrate, use, implement, execute, apply
- Analyze: compare, contrast, differentiate, examine, question
- Evaluate: assess, justify, defend, critique, prioritize
- Create: design, construct, develop, formulate, produce

### Mastery Definition

A student demonstrates mastery when they can:

1. **Explain** the DE framework's logic (why this sequence, why customer-first)
2. **Apply** each step to a novel business context, not just their class venture
3. **Evaluate** another team's work and provide constructive, specific feedback
4. **Defend** their team's decisions with evidence from customer research
5. **Present** their venture compellingly to a skeptical audience
6. **Iterate** based on feedback without becoming defensive or discouraged

Mastery is demonstrated through the final pitch and the journey of weekly improvements, not through a written test.

## Content Guidelines

### Concepts Per Session

Given our 100-minute sessions and need for substantial team workshop time:

- **Maximum new DE steps per session:** 3 (with exceptions for denser content)
- **Revisited concepts for reinforcement:** 1-2 from prior sessions
- **Total concept touches per session:** 4-5

Each session focuses on one coherent theme (e.g., "Who is your customer?") even when covering multiple steps.

### Theory/Practice Balance

Target allocation for each 100-minute session:

| Activity | Time | Percentage |
|----------|------|------------|
| Opening (pitches Week 3+, hook) | 15-20 min | 15-20% |
| Concept introduction | 25-30 min | 25-30% |
| Team workshop | 40-45 min | 40-45% |
| Share/feedback | 10-15 min | 10-15% |
| Wrap-up & homework | 5 min | 5% |

**Key ratio:** At least 50% of class time is active student work (workshop + pitches + share-outs).

### Visualization Guidelines

Based on research, visualizations should:

1. **Be readable at 80" TV distance AND over Zoom** — minimum font sizes enforced per master-presentation-spec.md
2. **Animate to build understanding** — reveal complexity progressively, not all at once
3. **Use consistent color coding** — DE theme colors (blue for customer, purple for value, etc.) throughout
4. **Enable interaction where possible** — click to expand, hover for details, configurable axes
5. **Connect to student deliverables** — visualizations should preview what teams will create

### Pacing Guidelines

- **New concept introduction:** Maximum 8-10 minutes before interaction or example
- **Workshop check-ins:** Instructor circulates every 10-15 minutes
- **Pitch + feedback:** 3-4 minutes per team (2 min pitch + 1-2 min feedback)
- **Transition buffer:** 2-3 minutes between major segments

## Misconception Handling

### Strategy

Misconceptions are addressed through a three-phase approach:

1. **Surface explicitly:** Name the misconception directly; acknowledge students may believe it
2. **Provide counter-evidence:** Cite research, show contrary examples, present data
3. **Reinforce through experience:** Design activities where the truth of the counter-position becomes self-evident

We don't shame students for holding misconceptions—these beliefs are culturally reinforced. We treat correction as revelation, not rebuke.

### Specific Misconceptions Schedule

| Misconception | When Addressed | Technique |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Entrepreneurs are born, not made | Class 0 (opening) | Direct debunking with evidence; "craft" framing |
| You need a brilliant original idea | Class 0-1 | Problems-first approach; execution emphasis |
| Entrepreneurs are risk-takers | Class 0, reinforced Class 8 | De-risking through validation; MVBP testing |
| Solo genius myth | Class 0, ongoing | Team structure; spotlight on founding teams |
| Must start big | Class 1 (beachhead) | Specificity emphasis; case studies of narrow starts |
| Product comes first | Class 1-2 | Customer-first sequence; persona before product |
| Everyone is my customer | Class 1 | Segmentation matrix; beachhead selection |
| User = buyer | Class 5 | DMU mapping; stakeholder identification |

### Ongoing Reinforcement

Watch for misconception re-emergence, especially:
- When teams describe their market as "everyone who..."
- When teams want to skip customer research and "just build"
- When individual students dominate team presentations
- When teams resist pivoting despite contrary evidence

---

## Assessment Philosophy

Assessment serves learning, not ranking. The pass/fail structure is intentional: we want risk-taking, iteration, and honest acknowledgment of what doesn't work. A graded environment would penalize the pivots and failures that are essential to entrepreneurial learning.

### Formative Assessment (Ongoing)

**Weekly mechanisms:**
- Elevator pitch feedback (qualitative, immediate)
- Workshop observation (instructor circulates, provides real-time guidance)
- Deliverable review (written feedback on submitted work)
- Peer feedback quality (are students developing critique skills?)

**Instructor looks for:**
- Evidence-based claims (not just assertions)
- Increasing specificity over time
- Responsiveness to feedback (visible iteration)
- Quality of customer research documentation

### Summative Assessment (Final)

**Final Pitch Evaluation Criteria:**

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Customer Understanding | 25% | Clear persona, validated pain points, real quotes |
| Value Proposition | 20% | Quantified value, differentiated positioning |
| Business Model | 20% | Viable economics, realistic acquisition process |
| Presentation Quality | 15% | Clear, compelling, all members contribute |
| Evidence of Iteration | 10% | Visible learning journey, pivots acknowledged |
| Response to Q&A | 10% | Thoughtful handling of judge questions |

**What we're NOT evaluating:**
- Whether the idea is "fundable" or likely to succeed
- Technical sophistication of the product concept
- Prior business knowledge or vocabulary

## Success Metrics

How do we know if this course is working?

### Student-Level Metrics

1. **Completion of weekly deliverables** — Are teams keeping pace with the cumulative work?
2. **Quality of customer research** — Are students actually talking to potential customers, or making assumptions?
3. **Iteration evidence** — Do pitches evolve week-over-week based on feedback and learning?
4. **Peer feedback quality** — Are students developing the ability to give constructive critique?
5. **Final pitch competence** — Can teams articulate their venture using DE framework language?

### Course-Level Metrics

1. **Engagement trajectory** — Does participation increase or decrease over the semester?
2. **Cross-campus collaboration** — Are mixed Durham-Morganton teams functioning effectively?
3. **Team health** — Are teams stable, or are there significant dysfunction patterns?
4. **Framework internalization** — Do students reference DE concepts unprompted in discussions?
5. **Post-course application** — Do students apply entrepreneurial thinking in other contexts? (difficult to measure short-term)

### Red Flags to Watch

- Teams with zero customer conversations documented
- Same person always presenting for a team
- Pitch content unchanged week-over-week
- Students unable to explain why they made key decisions
- Low attendance or disengagement in workshop time

## Instructor Notes

### Setting the Right Culture (Class 0-1)

The first two sessions establish the culture for the entire course. Key moves:

- **Be vulnerable:** Share your own entrepreneurial failures and pivots
- **Normalize uncertainty:** "I don't know" is an acceptable answer if followed by "but here's how we'd find out"
- **Model feedback:** Give specific, actionable feedback early to demonstrate the expected quality
- **Protect psychological safety:** Celebrate questions; never mock wrong answers

### Managing Team Dynamics

With 6-person teams, expect:
- Some free-riders (address through peer feedback and participation tracking)
- Dominant personalities (actively redistribute presentation time)
- Campus divides (encourage cross-campus pair work)
- Skill imbalances (ensure everyone contributes, even if not equally)

**Intervention points:**
- If one person always presents: "We want to hear from [name] this week"
- If team seems stuck: 1:1 check-in to understand blockers
- If conflict emerges: Facilitate direct conversation; normalize disagreement as healthy

### Adapting to the Room

The schedule is a guide, not a script. Adjust based on:
- If pitches are running long → Shorten concept section that week
- If a concept isn't landing → Add more examples before moving to workshop
- If teams finish workshop early → Use time for additional share-outs or discussion
- If energy is low → Move physical activity up; change the rhythm

### Technology Considerations

Given dual-campus delivery over Zoom:
- Ensure Morganton students can hear in-room discussions
- Repeat in-room questions for remote participants
- Use shared digital workspaces (Miro, Google Docs) for collaborative exercises
- Test audio/video before each session
- Have backup plan for technology failures

### Relationship with Chad Keister

The Wednesday work sessions with Chad are crucial. Coordinate on:
- What was covered Monday (so Chad can reinforce)
- Which teams need extra support
- Homework expectations and due dates
- Student concerns that emerge during work sessions
