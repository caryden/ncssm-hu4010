# Gate 1: Lesson Plan Alignment Checklist

Use this checklist to verify a lesson plan before proceeding to presentation spec.

---

## Prerequisites Check

- [ ] `course-plan.md` exists and was referenced
- [ ] `research/research-{topic}.md` exists for this topic
- [ ] Lesson plan file created in correct location

---

## Objective Quality

### Traceability
- [ ] Each objective maps to a course plan principle
- [ ] Mapping is documented in the alignment table
- [ ] No objectives are disconnected from course philosophy

### Measurability
- [ ] Every objective starts with an action verb
- [ ] Bloom's taxonomy level is appropriate
- [ ] Objectives avoid vague terms ("understand", "know", "learn")

**Acceptable verbs by level**:
| Level | Verbs |
|-------|-------|
| Remember | define, list, identify, name, recall |
| Understand | explain, describe, summarize, paraphrase |
| Apply | calculate, demonstrate, use, implement, solve |
| Analyze | compare, contrast, analyze, differentiate |
| Evaluate | evaluate, critique, justify, assess, judge |
| Create | design, construct, develop, formulate, produce |

### Achievability
- [ ] Objectives can realistically be achieved in class time
- [ ] Prerequisites are acknowledged
- [ ] Complexity matches student level

---

## Activity Alignment

For each objective:

| Objective | Supporting Activity | Assessment Method |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1. {obj} | {activity} | {assessment} |
| 2. {obj} | {activity} | {assessment} |
| 3. {obj} | {activity} | {assessment} |

- [ ] Every objective has at least one activity
- [ ] Every objective has an assessment method
- [ ] Activities logically support their objectives

---

## Time Validation

| Segment | Planned Time | Realistic? |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| {segment 1} | {time} | [ ] Yes |
| {segment 2} | {time} | [ ] Yes |
| ... | ... | ... |
| **Total** | {total} | |

- [ ] Times sum to class duration (±5 minutes)
- [ ] Buffer time included for transitions
- [ ] No segment is unrealistically short
- [ ] No segment dominates without justification

---

## Research Integration

- [ ] Misconceptions from research are explicitly addressed
- [ ] Visualization patterns from research are referenced
- [ ] Expert teaching techniques from research are incorporated
- [ ] At least one research source informs the approach

---

## Differentiation

- [ ] Scaffolds identified for struggling students
- [ ] Extensions identified for advanced students
- [ ] Multiple entry points for diverse learners

---

## Gate 1 Result

### PASS Criteria
All checkboxes above are checked.

### FAIL Actions

If any check fails:

1. **Missing objective traceability**
   - Review course-plan.md principles
   - Add explicit mapping to alignment table

2. **Vague objectives**
   - Replace with action verbs
   - Make measurable

3. **Missing activities**
   - Add activity for each objective
   - Ensure format and instructions are clear

4. **Time issues**
   - Adjust segment durations
   - Consider cutting content if overloaded

5. **Research not integrated**
   - Re-read research document
   - Explicitly incorporate findings
