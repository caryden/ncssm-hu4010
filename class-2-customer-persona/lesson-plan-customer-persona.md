# Class 2: Customer Persona & TAM

**Date:** February 16, 2025
**Duration:** 100 minutes (6:15 - 7:55 PM)
**DE Steps:** 3 (End User Profile), 4 (Calculate TAM), 5 (Profile the Persona)

---

## Session Overview

Building on the beachhead selection from last week, students now dive deep into understanding their specific customer. This session covers three interconnected steps: building an end user profile, calculating the Total Addressable Market (TAM), and creating a detailed persona. The goal is to move from "a segment" to "a real person I understand deeply."

Key insight: **Your persona should feel like a real person you could call and have coffee with.**

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. **Build** a comprehensive End User Profile based on research (not assumptions)
2. **Calculate** TAM using bottom-up methodology
3. **Create** a data-driven Persona that guides all decision-making
4. **Distinguish** between assumptions and validated knowledge
5. **Conduct** effective primary market research conversations

## Key Concepts

### End User Profile (Step 3)
A detailed description of the actual person who will use your product. This is NOT the same as the economic buyer (who pays) in B2B contexts.

**Profile Elements:**
- Demographics: Age, gender, location, education, income
- Psychographics: Values, motivations, fears, aspirations
- Behaviors: Daily routines, technology usage, buying habits
- Context: Where/when they experience the problem
- Current solutions: What they do today to address the problem

### Total Addressable Market (Step 4)
The total revenue opportunity available if you achieved 100% market share in your beachhead.

**Two Calculation Methods:**

1. **Bottom-Up (Preferred)**
   - Count individual customers in segment
   - Multiply by price they'd pay
   - More accurate, based on research

2. **Top-Down (Sanity Check)**
   - Start with industry size
   - Apply filters to narrow to your segment
   - Less accurate, but useful for triangulation

**TAM Requirements:**
- Big enough to be worth pursuing (typically $5M-$50M for beachhead)
- Small enough to dominate (not competing with giants)
- Connected to larger follow-on markets

### Persona (Step 5)
A single, specific, fictional representation of your ideal customer, based on real data.

**Persona Elements:**
- Name and photo (humanizes the data)
- Demographic snapshot
- Day in the life
- Goals and frustrations
- Quote that captures their mindset
- Buying behavior

**Why One Persona?**
Having multiple personas dilutes focus. Pick the one customer who represents your best opportunity in the beachhead. All others are secondary.

## Session Outline

### Weekly Elevator Pitches (15 minutes)

This is the first week of elevator pitches! Each team's designated presenter has 2 minutes.

#### Format (15 min total)
- **Each team:** 2 min pitch + 1 min feedback
- **This week's focus:** Problem statement and target market
- **Presenter rotation:** Different team member each week

#### Feedback Framework
- Is the problem clear and compelling?
- Do I understand who the customer is?
- Questions I'd want answered
- **Encourage peer feedback** (not just from instructor)

---

### Opening (10 minutes)

#### Hook: The $1B Assumption Error (7 min)
Tell the story of a startup that built a product based on assumptions, not research. They assumed their customers wanted X, built for 18 months, launched... and nobody cared.

The fix wasn't a pivot—it was talking to customers FIRST.

**Bill Aulet quote:**
> "The goal of primary market research is not to sell, but to learn."

Contrast: Dropbox's approach—Drew Houston made a video showing the product before building it, watched who engaged, then talked to those people.

#### Homework Review (3 min)
- Quick check: Did teams have their customer conversations?
- Any surprising discoveries to share?

### Part 1: End User Profile (20 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (8 min)

**Who is the End User?**
The person who actually uses your product day-to-day. In many cases (B2C), this is also the buyer. In B2B, it often isn't.

| Context | End User | Economic Buyer |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Consumer app | User | User |
| Enterprise software | Employee | IT Director |
| Kids' educational game | Child | Parent |
| Medical device | Patient | Hospital/Insurance |

**Why it matters:** You must design for the end user's experience, but understand the economic buyer's motivations.

**Building the Profile:**

Key questions to answer through research:
- What does a typical day look like?
- Where does the problem occur in their day?
- How do they currently solve this problem?
- What frustrates them about current solutions?
- What would "better" look like?
- What matters most to them? (Speed? Cost? Quality? Status?)

#### Primary Market Research (12 min)

**The Art of Customer Interviews**

**DO:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Listen more than talk (80/20 rule)
- Ask "why?" repeatedly to dig deeper
- Focus on their past behavior (not hypotheticals)
- Take notes (or record with permission)

**DON'T:**
- Pitch your solution
- Ask leading questions
- Accept "I would probably..." (get specific examples)
- Assume you understand—verify

**Sample Question Framework:**
1. "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]..."
2. "What did you do about it?"
3. "How did that work out?"
4. "What would make that situation better?"
5. "How much time/money does this cost you?"

**Exercise:** Role-play a customer interview in pairs (5 min)

### Part 2: Calculating TAM (15 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (8 min)

**What is TAM?**
Total Addressable Market = The total revenue you could capture if you had 100% of your beachhead market.

**Why TAM matters:**
- Tells you if the market is worth pursuing
- Helps you set realistic goals
- Informs resource allocation
- Required for any investor conversation

**The Bottom-Up Method:**

```
TAM = (Number of customers) × (Average revenue per customer)
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. Identify how many potential customers exist in your beachhead segment
2. Estimate what they'd pay per year (based on research, not hope)
3. Multiply

**Example:**
- Beachhead: "Restaurant owners in Durham with 10-50 employees who need reservation systems"
- Research: 200 restaurants in Durham meet criteria
- Price research: Similar tools charge $200/month → $2,400/year
- TAM = 200 × $2,400 = **$480,000/year**

**Is that big enough?** Depends on your goals, but it's a starting point.

#### Calculation Workshop (7 min)

Teams work to estimate their TAM:
1. Define the population (how many customers?)
2. Research what they'd pay
3. Calculate and discuss

**Sanity check:** Does this feel right? What assumptions need validation?

### Part 3: Building the Persona (20 minutes)

#### Concept Introduction (8 min)

**From Profile to Persona**

The End User Profile gives you categories of information. The Persona turns that into a specific person.

**Why personify?**
- Easier to design for "Maria" than "female professionals 25-35"
- Creates shared understanding across your team
- Enables empathy-driven decision making
- Keeps you honest about who you're actually serving

**Persona Components:**

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Name & Photo | Humanize, make memorable |
| Demographics | Quick context |
| Quote | Capture their core mindset |
| Goals | What they're trying to achieve |
| Frustrations | What blocks them |
| Day in the Life | When/where problem occurs |
| Current Solution | What they do today |
| Tech Savvy | How they adopt new tools |

**The "Would They Buy?" Test:**
Look at your persona. Based on what you know:
- Would THIS person buy your product?
- Why specifically?
- What would convince them?

If you can't answer confidently, you need more research.

#### Persona Creation Workshop (12 min)

Teams create their persona using the template:

1. **Name the persona** (make it memorable)
2. **Fill in demographics** (be specific)
3. **Write the quote** (what do they say that captures their mindset?)
4. **List 3 goals** (what are they trying to accomplish?)
5. **List 3 frustrations** (what blocks them?)
6. **Describe their current solution** (what do they do today?)

### Part 4: Share & Feedback (10 minutes)

#### Persona Presentations (8 min)
Each team has 2 minutes to present their persona:
- Name and photo/sketch
- The quote
- Key goals and frustrations
- Current solution

After each:
- Does this feel like a real person?
- Is it specific enough?
- What questions would you want answered?

#### Feedback Discussion (2 min)
- Common patterns across personas
- Quick gaps identified—use Wednesday sessions to follow up

## Instructor Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize
- Research > Assumptions (constantly reinforce)
- The persona is a tool, not a work of art—it should be useful
- TAM is a living number—it will change as you learn more

### Common Mistakes to Watch For
- Personas based on assumptions, not conversations
- TAM that is wildly optimistic (or pessimistic)
- Confusing end user with economic buyer
- Skipping the "current solution" analysis

### Facilitation Tips
- Push teams to be more specific ("What does '25-35' mean exactly?")
- Ask "How do you know that?" frequently
- Celebrate teams that discover their assumptions were wrong
